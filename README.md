# Music Review Generative AI Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a system for analyzing music review texts and classifying them into various categories. The system identifies elements such as lyrics mentions, artist context, genre context, sound/production, historical context, cultural/social commentary, emotional response, reference/comparison, and explicit evaluation in review texts.

## Importance of Music Criticism
Music criticism plays a vital role in shaping cultural discourse and understanding musical works in their broader context. As prior research suggests (Smith et al., 2019; Johnson, 2021), professional music criticism provides frameworks for interpretation and evaluation that enhance listener experiences and contextualize artistic contributions.

## Components of Music Criticism
Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we analyzed the structural components of music reviews to better understand their composition:

- **Binary Classification Tasks**: We performed binary classification on collected reviews to identify the presence of:
  - Lyrics mentions
  - Artist context
  - Genre context
  - Sound or production discussion
  - Historical context
  - Cultural or social commentary
  - Emotional response
  - Reference or comparison
  - Explicit evaluation

## Comparative Analysis Approach
Our research compares different approaches to music review generation and analysis:
1. **Music + Metadata**: Using only the music and basic metadata to inform review generation
2. **Music + Metadata + Context**: Incorporating additional contextual information about the artist, genre, and cultural background

## Dataset
The project utilizes a diverse collection of music reviews, each structured in the following format:
