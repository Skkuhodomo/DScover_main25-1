    "review_text": "Imagine you were a collector of folk songs in 1970s Kyiv, a student at the Conservatory, and a member of the Leninist Youth League (obligatory if you wanted easier access to higher ed). Coming back from weekend expeditions to rural villages, you would deposit your field recordings in the archive, but not before you edited them—excising references to gods, Christian or otherwise, or songs too tragic for the Communist Party, which expected optimism from the folk. Composers in the Conservatory might draw from your collections and adapt them for the saccharine folklore ensembles sponsored by the Soviet state.\nImagine you wanted to sing like the women you heard in the village, with the full gritty materiality of your body, even though (or especially because) it was not sanctioned by the state. Imagine that you and your friends, your fellow students and folk-song collectors, gathered in secret to sing the suppressed repertoires and learn the techniques of village vocality, with its grain and improvisational drift. Imagine that the clandestine chorus kicked off what would eventually become a movement to recuperate unruly singing from the homogenization machine of the Soviet state. Imagine that 30, 40, 50 years later this kind of singing would come to signify defiance, become known as a postcolonial music, a tactic of imperial refusal.\nIn modern Ukraine, this style is commonly referred to as avtentyka, literally “authentic” music. It is a style and a cultural movement that, at its most dynamic, embraces the obvious paradox of studied authenticity, which claims roots in pre-Christianity but encompasses changes introduced over the millennium that followed. In 21st-century wartime Kyiv, avtentyka groups have staged dance parties in Metro stations and study groups in museums. Today’s “authentic” Ukrainian folk is part of acultural revivalrooted in the rejection of Putinist authoritarianism, and in the older dream of a music and a life uncorrupted by state power.\nOnГільдеґарда(Hildegard), a new album first presented as a performance at last year’sUnsound festivalin Krakow, Ukrainian artists Heinali and Andriana-Yaroslava Saienko repurpose this modern-authentic Ukrainian voice to interpret medieval plainchant: the religious songs of the German nun, mystic visionary, and idiosyncratic composer Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179). The mesmerizing two-track album presents two of Hildegard’s compositions,“O Ignis Spiritus Paracliti” (“O Fire of the Spirit and Defender”) and“O Tu Suavissima Virga” (“O Sweetest Branch”), in unhurried arrangements; each track approaches 20 minutes in length. While Hildegard’s melodies and Latin text are faithfully reproduced, the songs are otherwise unconstrained, allowed to meander and soar, unfolding through the interplay of generative patches and improvised vocalizations. Veering sharply away from the typical contemplative renditions of Hildegard’s devotional songs,Hildegardsets up a confrontation between the immensity of spiritual passion and the elemental power of sound, expressed through the searing authentic-modern voice of Saienko and the mutable, enveloping textures of Heinali’s synthesizer."

    "review_text": "There must be something in the water in Copenhagen, where for the past few years a cohort of rising artists have been making sublime, hyperreal songs in singer-songwriter mode, but from an electronic background. Somemembersof this scene transmute guitar music through MIDI, giving their pastoral landscapes a freaky sheen;othersapply classical training to homespun electroacoustic R&B. These loosely connected artists meet somewhere between the Danish countryside and the uncanny valley, capturing different angles of the “real world” as mirage: shimmering, bending, retreating.\nFrom this pool of talent emerges the debut album of Fine Glindvad Jensen, who makes music as Fine. The singer and producer studied at Copenhagen’s esteemed (and free) Rhythmic Music Conservatory, whose alumni includeML Buch,Erika de Casier,Molina, andAstrid Sonne. She’s spent a decade as the vocalist for the electro-pop group CHINAH, collaborates with Sonne in a side project calledCoined, and co-wrote songs for K-pop superstarsNewJeanswith de Casier last year. ButRocky Top Ballads, her first full-length solo project, stems from a childhood memory of hearing her bluegrass musician father play his banjo through the wall: “You can hear it,” she recalled in aninterviewthis year, “but you can’t really hear it.”\nThe songs onRocky Top Ballads—sample-based productions with organic instrumentation, written and produced by Fine—tell a story of a love affair that’s hard to understand. “You kiss me like a stranger,” she sighs on “Coasting,” downtempo dream pop for the spa or chillout lounge. Then she delivers to her lover a cryptic prophecy: “You’ll meet me in a bathtub/Upon a mountain.” These enigmatic characters move through a quiet, intense world that seems suffused with meaning that’s just beyond our grasp: the night sky turns strange colors, fires burn in the rain, and people often get lost, purposely or otherwise. The lovers keep leaving, or wishing they hadn’t, or begging the other to stay, though it’s hard to tell which one is which, or why they have to go. “There’s something/I’m leaving/Every day/Something I have to give you...” Fine sings softly on the twangy “Losing Tennessee,” but she doesn’t ever say what it might be.\nOn songs like that one, with its campfire sing-along vibe, Fine throws an alt-country curveball into the Copenhagen scene. Elsewhere she wallows in melancholy ’90s rock, channeling the mythic dreamworlds ofthe CranberriesorCocteau Twinson the transcendent “Big Muzzy.” (“Oh, why can’t you stay?” she trills angelically, then doubles back a minute later: “I’m so sorry I had to leave.”) I hearUltraviolence-eraLanain the dark surf-rock of “A/B,” the ache ofGrouperin “Days Incomplete”’s sparse coda, and throbs ofZero 7’s “In the Waiting Line” in the dead-sexy trip-hop of “Remember the Heart.” Looming above it all isMazzy Star’s Hope Sandoval, whose detached gaze and whispered vocals echo as Fine murmurs a command—“Get lost with me, my love”—looking past her lover towards some point on the horizon."

    "review_text": "When Aya Sinclair was a teenager growing up in Huddersfield—a town in the north of England between Manchester and Leeds—she felt herself come to life in the swell of Christian rock. Someone sang about the Lord and blissful frisson radiated through her. Sinclair believed that feeling was the Holy Spirit. She joined a Pentecostal church. She worshiped. Then she felt another stirring. At first, it manifested as a sneaking aversion to the path laid before her: a university education, marriage, children, a nice job, a quiet home in the suburbs. The shadow of convention squeezed the air out of her life. She realized she might be queer. Sinclair confided in her church’s leaders, and they told her to keep herself locked in the closet or leave. She left. She went to Manchester, got into clubs, started making dance music, started using drugs, transitioned, found euphoria bubbling far, far away from the Holy Spirit’s reach.\nSinclair’s debut album asaya, 2021’sim hole, paired derealized drone confessionals with gabber-lite wallops. It was, she’s said, a ketamine album, an attempt to render the effects of the drug on the body by retooling the framework of the dance song. Standout “what if i should fall asleep and slipp under” is, structurally, pop, with verses and a refrain that you might call a hook if aya hadn’t hollowed out its beat and tossed it in the gutter. “Come over, we could fuck the void out of each other,” she teased, her voice slithering through waves of distortion, like she was promising a unilaterally bad time.\nNow based in South London, aya wrote and recorded her second album,hexed!, from the perspective of early sobriety. During the first months of her recovery from substance abuse, she dug back into the memories she carried from her most acute terrors: cocaine-fueled all-nighters, dissociative panic attacks. The album roves, swarms, and stews like a mind starving for intensity, galloping along to the next high on bleeding legs. Deep in its mesmerizing glut are some astonishing works of synthesis. Sound bristles, foams, bursts, and oozes, lashing its acid against aya’s newly ferocious vocals. She presided overim holelike the emcee inMulholland Drive’s Club Silencio scene: with wry, knowing diction, a little smirk on her lips, secure in the knowledge that none of what was happening was real. Onhexed!, it’s real. She knows it. She tries to keep up the cool facade and she keeps getting dragged into the furnace."

    "review_text": "Dean Bluntisin the studiowithA$AP Rocky,on the streetswithYung Lean,at the amusement parkwithPanda Bear, on Mowalola’smoodboard, inNettspend’scloset, and yet nowhere to be found. Over the past decade or so, he’s become a folk hero for information-era introverts, web trawlers who would rather create than stick around for conversations about what they’ve made. The official spokeswoman of World Music—Blunt’s shadowy self-run record label—is Denna Frances Glass, a fictional character we are meant to believe handles the YouTube channel “dennafrancesglass.” On this channel, “Glass” uploads (and frequently deletes) fleeting efforts by a rotating cast of characters:the Crying Nudes, former World Music signeesBar Italia, DJ Escrow ofBabyfather, and others likely to be found trading WeTransfer links with Blunt. The most thrilling are the uploads that prove Blunt’s universe, insular as it may seem, is ever-expanding. Take last summer’s sputtering “bluey vuitton,” in which he loses the IDGAF war over anevilgianebeat. Like it? Fire up your preferred YouTube-to-MP3 service, because it’ll be gone next week.\nBy the time this review gets published, it’s likely that Blunt’slatest upload, a sparse collection of untitled tracks featuringElias RønnenfeltandVegyn, will be gone, too. But temporary as it may be—in both length (16 minutes) and official online existence—the transience feels apt for the music, which scans as a soundtrack for trying to remember a dream about your crush.lucremarks yet another guitar-centric release for Blunt, whose most recent efforts—notably the Joanne Robertson collaborationBackstage Raverand the data dumpHackney Commercial Waste—foregrounded chorus pedals, demo-level digi-rock, and a lot of lightly-distorted noodling. Blunt doesn’t sing onlucre, but if we are to assume that it’s him playing strings, then this is a focused, compact showcase of his grasp of the guitar ballad: less languid than his earliest attempts, and as tender as any Blunt release has ever sounded.\nThe tenderness is largely owed to Rønnenfelt, a newly solo balladeer fresh off a wistful guitar albumof his own. He and Vegyn have made cameos in Blunt’s music before—Rønnenfelt on “Smile Please” and “Repeat Offenders”; Vegyn on such loosies as “TROLL” and “DOWNER”—thoughlucremostly nests somewhere betweenHeavy GloryandBlack Metal 2. Blunt’s has long been a hyper-online take on post-punk, the sound of iPhone mics propped against mini-amps, scuzzy stems laid over stolen drum samples. Rønnenfelt’s solo work implies similar, self-made rock-star inclinations, but he also shares with Blunt a certain trajectory: revered forrougher edges, freshly showing a softer side. Five years ago, track 2’s instrumental might have fit snugly on the dissociativeRoaches 2012-2019; onlucre, it goes from lovelorn to lovestruck, Blunt’s baritone exchanged for Rønnenfelt’s doe-eyed drawl. “Since I’ve been lying, I don’t mean a thing I say,” Rønnenfelt wails at one point, and it’s almost jarring: an extremely Dean Bluntian sentiment, delivered with extremelynotDean Bluntian desperation. Blunt’s footprint is most evident in the EP’s ragtag riffage, buoyed by production we canprobablyattribute to Vegyn. I’m not sure whether to call it track 3 or 4—a very Bluntian thing: no official tracklist!—but there’s a moment, around 4:49, where a brooding slow burn suddenly sputters into what sounds likeLou Reedcovering aCardiganssong. It’s a sly twist in a record full of them, proof that Blunt and friends always have a few tricks up their sleeves."

    "review_text": "There comes a time when devotees ofBruce Springsteenstart obsessing over the music hedidn’trelease. Once you’ve made it through the studio albums and B-sides, the live records and bootlegs, you’ll hear rumors of all the music left in a vault somewhere in the swamps of Jersey—casualties of a dogged perfectionism that led the endlessly prolific songwriter to consider scrapping evenBorn to Runand leaving “No Surrender” offBorn in the U.S.A.\nAt this point in your fandom, you may decide that disc two ofTracks—1998’s four-disc, career-spanning outtakes collection thatstillmanaged to disappoint some fans for not being comprehensive enough—is the best record he ever made. You may go to a concert holding up a sign to hear “Zero and Blind Terry.” You may insist there’s a scrapped album from the ’90s inspired by West Coast hip-hop—and that it might finally be coming out soon. Friends and family might start to worry about you.\nWhile I understand this all could sound fanatical, no one has perpetuated the mythology more than Springsteen himself. With this review ofTracks II: The Lost Albums, I’ve now covered 11 official releases for this website, and by the time that pretty much all of them were published, he was already in the press talking about the next thing he was working on. (Thestreak continues:Tracks IIIis finished. As is a new solo album.) Even given this history,Tracks IIholds a special place for Springsteen fans. WhereTrackscompiled individual songs that were cut from his famously exacting studio albums, the long-awaited sequel presents entire projects that he wrote, recorded, and, for one reason or another, decided not to release. Some songs have been passed around in rough form for decades; most are unknown to even the most serious collectors.\nBefore we get to the music—seven previously unreleased albums recorded between 1983 and 2019, 83 songs, the majority of them excellent—it’s important to situate Springsteen as a legacy artist in 2025. WhereBob Dylancontinues his Bootleg Series in the form of expertly crafted museum exhibitions, andNeil Youngopens his Archive as an ever-expanding garage sale where the mess is part of the charm, Springsteen engages with his past in the present tense. These days, it’s not uncommon for him towrite belated lyricsto a vintage instrumental, or revisit 50-year-old songs fora brand new record, or place his 1987 outtake “The Wish” asthe emotional centerpieceof his autobiographicalBroadway show. “I always picture it as a car,” heexplainedof his body of work—and what else. “All your selves are in it. And a new self can get in, but the old selves can’t ever get out. The important thing is, who’s got their hands on the wheel at any given moment?”"

    "review_text": "The microphone dangling from the sky above the Instagram Reels page can feel like a dare: How long before you scroll past this pastiche of a rapper you’ve heard before? So when a light-skinned young woman with curly hair and freckles namedCortisa Starappeared one day behind that microphone, rapping, “He like my body, he know I’m a tranny,” it felt like a glitch in the system. Her choppy vocals sounded like they were coming through a walkie-talkie that was too far away, and her ad-libs were delivered in aStar Warsrobot monotone. Everything felt out of place, especially for the beige world of Instagram Reels rap video content, and this experimentation was the hook that drew in fans, haters, and queerphobic bigots. Such is the polarized landscape of contemporary viral rap fame. Another Instagram account posted a quoteattributed to Cortisa: “I’m likeSOPHIEif she got posted on Worldstar.”\n“FUN,” the song featured in theinfamous From the Block video, blended regional and internet rap scenes, collapsing Jersey club bed squeaks into comedic levels of distortion. The dominant sound ofE.M.O. (EVIL MOTION OVERLOAD),Star’s debut EP, is more aligned with PC Music-branded hyperpop, a shift that positions her as a pop diva working on the borders of club music. But Star rarely sings, preferring to explore these soundscapes through her usual bratty punch-ins. WhileE.M.O.retains Star’s quick verses and head-turning one-liners, it lacks the adventurousness ofA.G. Cook’s pop productions, or the dizzying flows ofAzealia Banks’ hip house, focusing more on Star’s piercing,Kesha-like delivery.\nTake “ALOT,” a runway-ready track built off a rumbling four-on-the-floor pattern. The jumpy percussive bassline evokes the excitement ofCharli XCX’s SOPHIE-produced “Vroom Vroom,” but there aren’t enough moving parts for the track to fully develop; it keeps stalling, teasing some rhythmic shift or standout hook but never quite making it there. “FITS” suffers the same fate, grabbing attention with earthquake bass stabs that overwhelm Star’s performance, which settles in the same pocket without stretching out. The massive proportions and pristine finish of the sound design present as larger than life, but the songs wind up feeling like they’re all facade.\nStar is at her best when her blisteringly ironic wordplay is bolstered by production that’s equally self-aware. On “Cortisa Crump,” originally released in 2024, the tongue-in-cheek medieval chant sample and bowling-ball 808s help her unserious lines land. “Working these bitches like my name isBenson” sounds just as trashy as the low-bitrate choir recordings surrounding it. “Misidentify” works similarly; the high-drama buildup is so long it becomes funny. By the time she gets to “Mastered rapping high up, in the mountains with a samurai,” it’s like she’s poking fun at the entire hip-hop spectacle.\nIn a recentinterviewwithThe Fader, Star reflected on growing up as a queer rap fan: “I didn’t know too many queer rappers just because there wasn’t too many openly on the song saying, ‘I’m a tranny, I’m gay, this, this.’” What makesE.M.O. (EVIL MOTION OVERLOAD)more than a passing moment is its unabashed queerness to the point of vulgarity, a preemptive dismissal of any demand for respectability. When Star raps, “Fucked on that trade hoe and now I’m embarrassed” on “Paris,” it has an authentic bite; she’s not trying to make a statement, just talking to those already in the know.E.M.O’s abrasive sine waves, blown-out drums, and overproduced textures are familiar tropes of queer internet music that Star uses as a launchpad to explore her unique position as a transfemme in rap spaces. All she needs now is a sound palette that’s as distinctive as her vision of nonconformity."

    "review_text": "It tracks thatSabaandNo IDwouldtake a photography class together. Both of the Chicago-raised, Los Angeles-based artists pay close attention to the ephemeral, building songs from snatches of memory and rhythm. For Saba, focusing on the small things helps to settle racing thoughts and preserve everyday joys. “Life I be taking for granted, capture the moment, the Canon,” he rapped on 2018’s “SMILE,” chiding himself to be mindful. For No ID, observation is the bedrock of producing. The former DJ hasdescribedproduction as the art of “studying emotional reactions,” citing the way house music crowds and rappers picking beats give immediate feedback: “The speaker never lies. When you put the speaker on and something comes out, either people move or they don’t.”\nThat attentive approach has helped the producer sustain one of the most unique careers in rap. No ID has variously beenKanye’s mentor, Jermaine Dupri’s understudy, andBig Sean’s andVince Staples’ A&R. He helped usher in rap’s wintry Auto-Tune era through his work on808s and Heartbreakand producedJay-Z’s dad-rap missive “D.O.A.,” later pushing the notoriously composed rapper to unspool on4:44. He’s been so versatile for so long that when he pops up on albums as varied asRenaissance,Brent Faiyez’sWasteland, andKiller Mike’sMichael, you expect him to be there.From the Private Collection of Saba & No IDgoes further, merging and morphing the artists’ styles. The album plays like a love letter to Chicago rap, bridging the sample-driven boom-bap of No ID’s production forCommonwith the singsong lyricism of the YOUmedia scene that shaped Saba. The pair romps through this shared history like pirates, drunken with glee.\nSaba and No ID initially imagined the collab as a mixtape, but as they befriended each other and continued to record, it became an album. The title’s suggestion of wine cellars and Sotheby’s auctions is tongue in cheek: Although the svelte and opulent beats do bring to mind the plush arrangements of records like4:44,A Written Testimony, andNas’King’sDiseaserecords,From the Private Collectionisn’t mogul rap. Saba’s idea of comfort foregrounds proximity and connection over luxury: “Any moment sentimental now, when you with the niggas who was missing out,” he says early on, establishing the appreciative mood."

    "review_text": "Pa Salieustill had his three blue prison bagsslung over his shoulderswhen he arrived at Angelic Studios in Oxfordshire, England, at the start of September. The grin he wore, strapped broad across his cheeks, had stayed the journey from the prison gates, too. Pa had just been released after serving 21 months of a near-three-year sentence, handed down for his part in a 2018 brawl following the killing of his friend, Fidel Glasgow. Before his sentencing, Salieu had released astunning debut albumthat had him teed up for much bigger things. So once he got back into the studio, he produced a battered A4 notepad and got to work, chronicling his cellblock daydreams on family, freedom, and what it is to be African and feel alien in the UK. These reflections form the backbone ofAfrikan Alien, which flits from confrontation to catharsis over a melee of rap, millennial Afrobeats, spiritual mantras, and rolled log drums. It’s a brief rush, at a hair over 27 minutes, but covers a remarkable amount of ground. And as a blueprint for a new, pan-African pop music, it is thoroughly convincing.\nHe steps with lightness. “Allergy” turns and twitches like a flower’s bloom in timelapse, as Pa whirls over clip-clop percussion, drunk on a mantra: “I’m allergic to the bad vibes…I’m allergic to the BS.” The opening promise of “Belly”—“I been gone for a while, but I still make it back to you”—is at once about a girl, the outside world, and the music itself; the heavier tones of last month’s loosie “Crash” freestyle are notably absent here. It helps that his voice stirs like honey in hot water. He invites Black Sherif, Byron Messia, and ODUMODUBLVCK for a selection of box office cameos—the latter’s tear of a verse on “Big Smile” has the tension release of a race official’s starter pistol. And if there’s such a thing as a winter bop then “Soda,” with its addictive blend of cosy soca syncopation and cool amapiano stabs, is it.\nPa flirts with recognizable styles that have, in recent years, suffused the UK’s pop charts and made global stars of the likes ofBurna BoyandAsake. But he constantly tweaks the formulas. His overtures on the title track—“African the alien, moving like he’s nomadic…brought rhythms ’cause the spirit said it”—suggest a fixation on the horizon while carrying the precious cargo of his past with him. Songs like “Dece (Heavy)” and “Regular” thread a line from his grandmother’s car stereo in The Gambia, where Pa grew up, to the tracks trending on YouTube today.\nThe tape’s heart, though, lies in its most straightforward moment. There’s nothing startling about the solid, sax-and-strings head bop of “YGF,” or anything coded in the chorus the song’s initials come from: “Young, great, and free.” But it provides, with gospel choir backing, the deep, therapeutic exhale that Pa has been ready to release."

    "review_text": "Mimi Parkerhad been dead for exactly three weeks the first time that her widower,Alan Sparhawk,stepped back on a stage. Trampled by Turtles—a nominal bluegrass band whose music has long overflowed the genre’s oft-narrow container—had released its 10th album,Alpenglow, during Parker’s final days in late 2022. So the band invited Sparhawk, a hometown inspiration who had become their champion and friend, to drive the two hours south from Duluth to Minneapolis to join them onstage at a record-release show, as he and Parker had done so many times.\nIn a blue haze, the band stood stoically to Sparhawk’s side while he strummed the first chords ofLow’s “When I Go Deaf,” a hymn about finding grim silver linings amid the impossible ruins of oblivion. As they roared together into the song’s second half, Sparhawk repeatedly bent so far over his electric guitar that his blonde curls seemed nearly to sweep the floor, as if his body were about to break at the waist. And then, each time, the sound around him seemed to pull him back from that brink, to force him upright again. When it was over, he hugged founder Dave Simonett for a long time, as if grateful for the chance to be anywhere at all.\nThirteen months later, and another hour south in Minnesota, Trampled by Turtles held that same space for Sparhawk. They’d long talked about recording together, and soon after Sparhawk jumped on their bus as an unannounced guest duringa summer 2023 touralongsideWillie Nelson, he had some songs that needed a home. During two days amid the wintry isolation of the fabled Pachyderm Studios, where the Turtles had just finished an EP of their own, Sparhawk led the band through nine songs—three he’d started with Parker but never finished, two he’d just recorded for a solo album, and four that portrayed his struggles and reckonings with life since Parker’s death. Where he had warped his voice beyond recognition onWhite Roses, My God, as if circuitry were enough to rewire grief itself, he sang these songs unadorned, the band’s steadfast harmonies growing like branches from his oaken tone. As improbable as it may seem,With Trampled by Turtles—a raw snapshot of perfectly articulated hurt, and the first steps of navigating it for the rest of one’s life—is one of the most compelling records of Sparhawk’s career.\nThe narrative start of these nine numbers actually arrives at the record’s middle, the centerpiece called “Screaming Song.” It is, as the stages of grief go, a retroactive document of Sparhawk’s fit of shock when Parker died of ovarian cancer. “When you flew out the window and into the sunset, I thought I would never stop screaming,” he sings of that moment, a faint lilt to his burly voice. Over the next two minutes, he repeatedly settles back into that primal sensation as he remembers catching his breath after each bout of paroxysms. “I’m trying to be cool here,” he offers finally, “but, inside, I’m screaming this song.” The band picks up the pace and volume, like a horse that’s broken its reins. Ryan Young’s fiddle starts to howl, as if doing Sparhawk the favor of telling everyone else exactly how fucked up he feels inside while letting the singer off the hook. For two decades, Trampled by Turtles have mostly been a very good string band best suited for summer festivals and wide-eyed singalongs; this performance gets to the knotty viscera of their old-time antecedents."

Here was a guy with South Florida wicks rapping on drumlessDetroit beatsandchipmunk soul samplesas a new member ofMIKE’s New York–based label,10k. His penchant for shit-talking carved a distinct lane among the 10k crew, specifically MIKE,Sideshow, andJadasea, for whom flexes usually take a backseat to more inward-looking lyricism. When Niontay stumbles upon his own moments of personal contemplation, his rapid-fire deliveries help them cut bone-deep even while sandwiched between boasts. This is his world: veering through different styles of rap, never getting too topical but never shying away from the truth.\nFada<3of$,his debut album, was originally titled2009in homage to Niontay’s late friend, whose loss, he’s said, “completely changed his life.” According to Niontay, the switch toFada<3of$signifies his desire to manifest celebration alongside grief, his preferred philosophy for moving forward. Building on his jack-of-all-trades skill, Niontay curates a collection of vignettes that touch on love, loss, and perseverance. Mostly self-produced,Fada<3of$breezes through SoundCloud-infused Southern rap sounds, pulling fromShawty PimpandGucci Maneas much asLuckiand guest producersSurf Gang. These bite-sized songs almost feel like demos, but they sparkle with nostalgia for gold rims and TR-808s.\nExpanding an already diverse palette of regional rap styles,Fada<3of$embraces canonical Black genres that bolster the Pan-Africanist vision underlying Niontay’s music. On “So Lovely,” a sparse, sample-driven R&B slow jam, Niontay names everything he admires about his lover; the way his “I love you” matches the piano melody is something you might expect fromJanet JacksonorBrandy. The context-free list of traits is almost silly, but the cracks in his voice hint at a sense of desperation; it’s one of his most emotional cuts to date. “Old Kent Road Freestyle” sounds like a chase scene in a Blaxploitation film, or if a homie started freestyling during aSly and the Family Stonejam session. The psychedelic distorted bass and electric piano stabs have a sense of comic timing that helps Niontay’s charisma shine. His chewy bars roll out like miniature Black history lessons: “I give a nigga somethin’ to celebrate like Juneteenth,” “Million dollar convos with the crackas, I’m eating lunch.”\nWhile it can be dizzying hearing Niontay jump from style to style, the features provide context. The blown-out, hazy beat on “Post Game Pskr” has a Cadillac-on-hydraulics coolness wired for El Cousteau’s brand of pimp rap. Lo-fi textures sizzle and roil on “Poltergeist,” perfect for the moody world of Jadasea. “+100underdogs” is a New Jazz track, a styleDav1d has dabbled in before. Regardless of the terrain, Niontay adapts with chameleonic ease, unlocking flows like video game upgrades.Fada<3of$feels like more than just his; “Souljaman by Smv,” a track by R&B artistSMVin which Niontay’s voice doesn’t appear at all, is the most radical display of this communal design. Niontay wants his friends to come up with him."

Brokenhearted and facing a cancer diagnosis, his grandfather began making practical arrangements for his funeral, picking out a casket and refusing treatment for his illness. “At 13, that was the most impactful thing I’d seen,” he’ssaid. “Probably still is.”\nThis period of watching his grandfather, who he remembers as the “hardest, toughest man [he’s] ever known,” grapple with intense emotion stuck with Wasluck. He named his long-running musical project,Planning for Burial, after the experience, which also serves as a guiding ethos for the ashen intensity of his songs. Through gloomy, genre-blurring music that draws on bleary shoegaze, grayscale ambient, and virtually every strain of downcast, depressive metal, he confronts heavy emotions without succumbing to them. Building from the blown-out loner doom of early records like 2009’sLeavingto the expansive, enveloping gestures ofBelow the House, Wasluck has elaborated his vision, but his thematic fixations have stayed consistent. He mulls over the worst life has to offer—grief, loss, addiction, mental illness. But although his music is heavy, it’s never hopeless.\nFrom the opening moments ofIt’s Closeness, It’s Easy—the first Planning for Burial full-length since 2017—the world weighs heavily on Wasluck’s shoulders. Announced by a thunderous snare drum and snowblind tremolo picking, the record’s first track, “You Think,” is cacophonous and unsettled, the noise and feedback parting only for Wasluck to offer mumbled meditations on the passage of time and some unsparing self-assessments: “Always a mess,” he grumbles. “Even when I’m not.” The record is littered with these cryptic moments of self-reflection and self-laceration. As he memorably mutters on “A Flowing Field of Green,” “No need to dig, everywhere is a hole,” a mantra for those who, like him, feel the burden of existence in everything they see.\nBut Wasluck never fully gives himself over to misery; in momentsIt’s Closeness,It’s Easyeven begins to approach an uneasy optimism. “A Flowing Field of Green,” for all its melancholia, culminates in a conscious rejection of the call of the void. “Fresh Flowers for All Time,” despite its crushing instrumentation—reminiscent of the gothic, hard-edged shoegaze sound ofNothingorCold Gawd—reads like a love song. Though the prickly guitar work nearly swallows his vocals, he sings a prayer of constancy and devotion that gives the record its title: “It’s closeness, it’s easy, and I wouldn’t want anything more for all time.”"

    "review_text": "Note: This article contains references to suicide.\nSteeped in angst and cinematic instrumentation, the most recent wave of street rap emerging from the DMV area resembles a post-grunge equivalent to the region’s grungy, drill-inspired “free car” sound that gained traction in the early 2020s. Though there’s a rhythmic link between these movements, each using deadpan triplet flows and piercing hi-hat rolls to create a latticework of pulses, new faces likeJaeychino,HavinMotion, andNino Paidembrace meditative atmospheres and emotional sensitivity that sets them apart from their peers. Of these upstarts, Maryland’s Nino Paid delivers far and away the most refined iteration of this new sound. His beat selection isn’t quite as eccentric as the low-bitrate cybersludge backing Jaeychino’s mixtape output, but the cleaner sound design calls attention to his meticulous and affecting lyricism. Nino’s debut album,Can’t Go Bacc, and breakout singles like “Pain & Possibilities,” processed the memory of a turbulent childhood spent in abusive foster homes, surfacing excruciatingly detailed recollections in hopes of healing.\nLove Me As I Am, Nino Paid’s second full-length, is more rooted in the present. Though he’s still plagued by his past, the prevailing mood is urgency. Nino is acutely aware that relevancy—and his newfound financial stability—can be fleeting. “What if I’m already trying my hardest? Fuck that, what if I’m already done for?” he raps on “Something to Live For,” opening the album’s first verse. On “Play This at My Funeral,” his rumination takes on a fatalistic tone. “Nobody told me that kids like me, who grew up with ACEs [adverse childhood experiences], die way faster, so maybe I’m already cooked,” he raps over a muffled, guitar-driven production that sounds like earlyExplosions in the Sky. It’s the opposite of a victory lap, acknowledging that what’s gained can be easily lost, especially within the context of cyclical trauma.\nDespite writing through this depressive lens, Nino manages to impart a message of hope that transcends the tropes of contemporarypain rap: If everything is temporary, appreciate the time that you’re given and continue to live alongside your anxieties. “I’m comfortable spending this money, I know I can’t take it whenever my hearse come,” Nino raps on the chorus of “Redemption.” The track’s production is spacious and crisp, directing attention to Nino’s punched-in vocals, but it’s decorated with subtle details that feel immersive. On its own, the glistening keyboard loop might read as maudlin, but the short bursts of deep-fried bass and phantasmal ad-libs that drift between left and right blend a sense of paranoia into sadness."

    "review_text": "Leave it toDeerhoofto empathize with Frankenstein’s monster. The prolific quartet has spent much of its career finding beauty in ugliness: post-apocalypticcave drawings, achild-snatching milkman, chirpy noise-pop blasts aboutcrowsandducksandSatanandmore Satan. Their records remain coarse, raucous, immune to the veneer of staid professionalism that tends to afflict bands in their fourth decade of existence.\nNoble and Godlike in Ruin, either the noise-rock group’s 19th or 20th album (depending on whether you count the little-heard 1996 curioDirt Pirate Creed), certainly is. It takes its unusual title from Mary Shelley’sFrankenstein, a source of inspiration. Drummer Greg Saunier describes the album as “our low-budget, DIY Frankenstein: A sensitive, spurned, intelligent, dehumanized creature made out of people.” The record cover, a scraggly collage of the bandmates’ faces, stitched together, reflects the idea: a Deerhoofstein, if you will.\nAfter several years of one-off experiments—arapid-fire covers album, a first-everJapanese-language album, asolo recordfrom Saunier—the group returns to what you might call straightforwardly Deerhoof territory onNoble and Godlike in Ruin. But put the emphasis on Deerhoof, not straightforward. This is one of the band’s most abrasive albums to date, with mangled, fractured grooves like “Sparrow Sparrow” and “Ha, Ha Ha Ha, Haaa” that simulate the experience of realizing your open tabs are playing multiple songs simultaneously. An anarchic free-jazz squawk weaves its way through “Who Do You Root For?,” while “Disobedience” is as queasy and discordant as the mutiny Satomi Matsuzaki seems to be singing about: “99 to 1/Captain has a gun,” she cheerily exclaims. Songs don’t end so much as collapse into cacophonous outros.\nWhile Deerhoof’s last album, 2023’sMiracle-Level, captured the serrated immediacy of their live performances,Noble and Godlike in Ruinis cluttered and dense, sometimes overwhelmingly so. Everything feels stitched together, almost surgical—like, well, a Frankenstein monster. When the approach works, it’s exciting: “Kingtoe” has a perverse refrain (“You make machines/And I am one!”) and a woozy melody held together by a toy-like piano riff, with Matsuzaki’s interlocking vocals coming together in a round at the end. When it doesn’t, the band’s raw power is undermined by jumbled, overstuffed arrangements, as on the aforementioned “Disobedience.” There’s a majestic ballad lurking somewhere in “A Body of Mirrors,” but the maximalist arrangement gives it little room to breathe.\nBecause the group’s sensibility is filtered through Matsuzaki’s childlike wonder, Deerhoof haven’t always been thought of as a political band. Critics too often shrugged off their lyrics as nonsense. But longtime fans will recognize a radical leftist spirit that’s infiltrated their songwriting in recent years, with songs like 2014’s “Exit Only” and 2020’s “New Orphan Asylum for Spirited Deerchildren” taking surreal aim at the excess cruelties of modern American life. (As for walking the walk, they premiered this album’s lead singleon Craigslist, a rare tech platform that “isn’t blatantly supporting fascism.”)"

    "review_text": "Greg Ackell stood in the hallway at Downtown Recorders, cradling his band’s debut single, preparing to truck his producer. Paul DeGooyer had spent the day givingDrop Nineteens’ “Winona” the abrupt volume shifts that alt-rock radio in 1992 couldn’t get enough of. While DeGooyer mixed, Ackell stewed silently at the console. In an act of insubordinate whimsy, DeGooyer’s assistant engineer had secretly made his own “Winona” mix. He hard-panned two Ackell vocal takes, letting them paddle against the band’s steady current of shoegaze. The result traded drama for a wire-crackle warmth; Ackell credits it with reorienting how the band approached recording.\nAfter DeGooyer finished, Ackell snapped up the “Winona” two-inch tape and headed for the studio exit. Wise to the singer’s scheme, though, the producer got to the door first. What happened between their standoff and Ackell’s escape is lost to time. But Drop Nineteens got the tape to the assistant, paying him out of their own pockets to finish the mix, which made it on the band’s debut,Delaware. In the end, all DeGooyer could do was holler across the parking lot as Ackell sprinted to his car. “You’re a real piece of work, Greg!” the singer remembers him yelling. “You’re not the Rolling Stones!”\nBut at that point in their career, the ’Teens surely felt as untouchable as the Glimmer Twins. They were five loosely connected college kids with a strong work ethic and capricious instincts. Several of them had attended expensive New England prep schools: Ackell and drummer Chris Roof played in the same band at Northfield Mount Hermon, pursuing shared musical passions (Echo and the Bunnymen,R.E.M.,the Velvets) in a kind of pressurized bubble. The experience would serve them well as they navigated a similar bubble: the Boston indie rock scene. Drop Nineteens didn’t round into shape playing gigs or auditioning for local labels. They just did their studies, and in their downtime recorded tapes that whipped the UK music mags into a froth.\n1991presents the bulk of those tapes, remixed and remastered for the first time. The set has been billed as a “lost LP,” but these songs (circulated online asMayfield) were drawn from demos, recorded with slightly different band configurations. Together, they established Drop Nineteens’ reputation as leading lights of U.S. shoegaze. “The AmericanSlowdive!”Melody Makercrowed in their July 1991 review of the band’s first demo EP, hailing the “sonorous ambient music-for-cathedrals-on-fire delights within.” The mag awarded the demo—which they called “Mayfield,” after the opening track—their Single of the Week: a coup for an unsigned band."

    "review_text": "On December 11, 2024,Rio Da Yung OGwas released from an Arkansas federal prison after serving three years and eight months of a five-year sentence. Videos popped up onsocial mediaandgossip sitesshowing the Flint, Michigan, rapper hopping in and out of private jets and luxury vehicles, hugging his friends, and generally exuding a sense of deep relief. Two days later, he dropped “RIO FREE,” a nod to the “Free Rio” movement and a blistering addition to the pantheon offirst-day-outrapsongs. It bookends “Last Day Out,” a wistful track Rio recorded just before his bid, but doesn’t offer the same celebratory imagery he and his team were posting online everywhere. Instead, it’s bleak and acidic, with competing feelings of vitriol and triumph elbowing each other for breathing room over Wayne616 and BlueStrip’s insistent production.\n“RIO FREE” was a dual statement of purpose: a reassertion of dominance from one of the most prolific members of theMichigan sceneand a promise of a coming deluge of music. Before his incarceration, between 2019 and 2021, Rio had flooded the internet with an endless stream of material, but he didn’t entirely disappear while in prison—a slow, strategic drip of archival recordings kept the seat warm for his return. His style was simple but effective: outrageous one-liners delivered with the cool detachment of a master shit-talker over piano-driven beats that annihilated subwoofers. There was an irresistible urgency to Rio’s music, an energy he largely preserves onRIO FREE, a 26-minute EP released just shy of a month to the day he got out. It makes good on the pledge of its eponymous song, but it’s darker and more anxious than anything before it; you can hear Rio working to get his sea legs back, shifty-eyed and reeling from the years he spent behind bars.\nThere’s plenty of Rio’s signature aloof brutality—violence gets doled out nonchalantly, often described in single lines; women are mostly two-dimensional sex objects, if they appear at all—but it’s his paranoia and anger that color the project. Rio’s constantly on edge, drinking excessive amounts of lean and hiding beneath a stagnant cloud of weed smoke. He answers calls with his “scary voice” on “Rap War” and backs into parking spots on “OFF-RAP” to ensure he has an exit strategy. His boasts about money often sound as though he’s just counted it again to make sure it’s still there; anyone, friends and family members alike, could be out to get him. Occasionally, he’s able to process these anxieties with his trademark jarring humor: “I’m tired of people askin' why my cousin tell/I hope that n***a go to jail and don't get none of his mail,” he raps on “Uncle Sam.” But mostly, he just can’t shake the feeling of an impending reckoning: “I did some bullshit, I know my karma coming,” he asserts on the title track.\nThere are no features or hooks onRIO FREE, which reveals the limits of Rio’s power. He’s at his best when bouncing off someone else, the friendly competition pushing him into more outrageous territory. Nothing reaches the lunatic highs of hisDumb and Dumb3rseries withRMC Mikeor his more ludicrous moments in the packed-studio posse cuts that defined the scene (“Tired of buying jewelry and cars, I’m finna buy a goat,” a batshit line from the greatLil Yachty-Michigan-era jam “Run Down,” is an all-timer). His choice of production remains rooted in the sinister syncopated Michigan thump, a classic regional sound that sometimes feels repetitive, but the Milwaukee lowend influence on “Shake Back” is a fresh and welcome departure. Even if Rio is still reacquainting himself with his singular voice, it’s good to have him back."

    "review_text": "How was your Valentine’s Day? Did you perhaps spend it “naked, getting high on the mattress while the global market crashes,” maybe thinking about “new regimes, old ideas”? A decade removed from its romantically timed release,Father John Misty’sI Love You, Honeybearsounds shockingly prescient in its combination of hedonism and psychic terror. It’s hard to hear Josh Tillman sing in 2015 about getting “a useless education and a subprime loan” without wincing at just how much bleaker things would become in the ensuing years, how quaint his complaints of being “Bored in the USA” seem in our chaotic present.\nOf course, Tillman’s been along for that ride with us, court jester and cultural stenographer for the anthropocene: “Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?” he wondered on 2017’sPure Comedy; “they’re tacit fascists without knowing it,” he sang on last year’sMahashmashana. Still,I Love You, Honeybearfeels like the pinnacle of Father John Misty’s ethos, the cynic who desperately wants to believe that love can transcend our existential dread. In honor of its 10-year anniversary, Father John Misty has re-released a collection of demos from the album, originally sent out in 2015 as a bonus cassette calledI Luv You HB. Stripped of their luxe studio sheen, these songs ache with the vulnerability always lurking in their lyrics, previously masked by grand pianos, backing vocalists, and laugh tracks.\nIfI Love You, Honeybearsounds like the swell of finding the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, its demos reflect the cautiously giddy energy of a budding romance. Gone are the sweeping strings in the title track and the galloping mariachi band on “Chateau Lobby #4.” In their place, the humble strum of an acoustic guitar and Tillman’s naked vocals, clipping and echoing as he stress-tests his home recording equipment with his feverish vibrato. If the studio album uses extreme transparency to undermine sentimentality, betting that it’s impossible to dance to a line like “mascara, blood, ash, and cum” at a wedding or put a song about “the girl who just almost died in my house” on a prospective lover’s mixtape, the demos reveal just how down bad Tillman was at the time of their conception. When a cough catches in his throat before the final verse of “I Went to the Store One Day” (which, like most of the songs, appears under a different name in demo form), it almost sounds as if he’s taken aback by the sincerity of his grand domestic fantasy."

This isn't meant to be reductive—Brazilians have a deep sense of pride in their homeland, and they’ve found myriad poetic ways to express it in song. “100% Samba,” the lead single off ofRogê’sCuryman IILP, could easily be construed simply as one such celebration: An ecstaticcuicabuzzes alongside Rogê’s acoustic guitar and gigantic bass fromBADBADNOTGOOD’s Chester Hansen as Rogê proclaims how samba thrives on the vigor of the Brazilian people who developed and maintained its essence. But the track isn’t just a straightforward declaration of pride; he also acknowledges samba’s roots in Africa and how enslaved people in Brazil then forged its sound. The vibrant, expressive songs onCuryman IIreturn often to this theme: how Brazil's unique cultural identity is a product of its diverse ethnic populations.\nRogê (née Roger José Cury) got his start in Rio’s spirited Lapa neighborhood, where he was a fixture at samba-centric nightclubs. Here, he met collaborators likeThe Life Aquaticstar Seu Jorge, with whom he released an exceptional EP in 2020, and sambeiro Arlindo Cruz, with whom he would go on to garner a Latin Grammy nomination. He released six other solo albums of music that mixes samba with Música Popular Brasileira (MPB; Brazilian pop music) while living in Rio, earning him the status of a local legend. But like Carioca luminaries Sérgio Mendes and Antônio Carlos Jobim before him, Rogê saw life in Los Angeles as an opportunity to get his samba heard by more than just Brazilians, and moved there in 2019,partly at the behest of Jorge. When Menahan Street Band’s Thomas Brenneck launched his Diamond West label, he made Rogê's 2023 album,Curyman, its inaugural release, and served as its producer. While the albums’ titles are a play on Rogê’s last name, they’re also a reference to“O Vento” (“The Wind”)by bossa nova founding father Dorival Caymmi, which tells of the wind that propels boats that bring fisherman a lucrative catch of thecurimãfish. Rogê endsCurymancovering this song, and beginsCuryman IIinterpolating it. The song’s central metaphor—about the winds of change that can guide or challenge us—powers Rogê’s latest collection as he deepens his focus on sharing authentically Brazilian music with the world, while also tackling Brazil’s history and colonial past."

In matching up the tangerine dreamers in the former group and the dream syndicate outsiders in the latter, it would be a challenge tonotproduce something beautiful. The two bands are deeply steeped in the Chicago experimental music community, enthralled by 20th-century minimalism andSun Ra, constantly aiming for ecstatic peaks, and willing to ride a wavelength indefinitely.\nNaturally, their second album together delivers all their gorgeous hallmarks—warm harmonium drone, weightless synths, and Möbius strips of low end courtesy of Natural Information Society leaderJoshua Abrams. If you expect a little more this time around, it’s only because the bands have come so incredibly far individually in the last decade. Bitchin Bajas have consistently expanded their palette.Bajas Fresh, their 2017 career peak, sharpened their synths into diamonds of arpeggiated euphoria; the 2021Sun RatributeSwitched On Ralet them explore more amorphous and nocturnal zones; and 2022’s excellentBajacillatorsupdated their sound with the hyperreal blips ofLaurie Spiegel’s Music Mouse software, sounding like a connection between the Berlin school and Japanese ambient. For their part, Natural Information Society have simply become one of best American rock bands going: a propulsive, celebratory dance act endlessly grooving somewhere on the perimeters of Afrobeat, avant-jazz, Gnawa music, andSteve Reich.\nOnTotality, NIS mostly deal in atmosphere and drama. Nearly 17 minutes long, the self-titled opener pulsates and throbs with specks of percussion and errant electronics, spiraling like dank, dazed, psychonautical jams in the vein of theGrateful Dead’s “Dark Star” orBlack Sabbath’s “Planet Caravan.” Around the 12-minute mark, Abrams kicks into a lackadaisical 7/8 bassline and the track slowly morphs into aJon Hassell-style dance under the moonlight. Side B sprawler “Always 9 Seconds Away” has a similarly sleepy crawl but plays like a doom-jazz version of the memory game Simon, its disjunctive melody growing like lichen."

The six-deep crew of producers—Uyama Amane, Kabanagu, hirihiri, phritz, quoree, and yuigot—were first acquainted through thenetlabel scene,collaboratinginvariouspermutations. When the six of them eventually got together in a Discord server, it wasn’t without growing pains. The group circulated project files, encouraging others to add their own ideas. The laissez faire attitude of the internet imprints they operated under exposed them to vastly different musical approaches, encouraging experimentation without pressure for results. Sometimes there were long gaps from one person’s contribution to the next.\nOver time, they attuned to the same wavelength. They all switched to working in Ableton Live, making it easier to share files. Turnaround times shortened to one day. Passing tracks back and forth became a trust exercise, each member deferring to their bandmates’ cuts or changes. “If they say so,” phritz said in an interview withFNMML, “that’s just how it is.” Collaboration became friendly competition as they tried to one-up each other with increasingly wild ideas. PAS TASTA worked almost exclusively through group chats, but still managed to generate buzz and draw in more collaborators. By the time 2023’sGOOD POPcame together, the album had ballooned into a sprawling snapshot of Japanese internet music.\nGRAND POPbroadens the scope further, this time taking stock of the entire J-pop landscape. On “My Mutant Ride” they bring in Taku Inoue—whoselong listof credits includes compositions forvideo games,virtual idols, andonline influencers—to play breezy guitar over the syrupy-sweet bubblegum bass track. (Though he’s pop royalty, Inouecalls himselfa “PAS TASTA fanboy,” as if he’s the one starstruck.) They pull an even bigger name for “Suburban,” supporting the booming voice ofanisonlegendTatsuya Kitaniwith an amped-up J-rock shredder. Guitar by Kitani and synthesized sounds lurch forward and back as Kitani soars over the melody, his voice occasionally glitching into a twisted mass. It has all the energy of one of Kitani’sanime openings, with the unmistakable, welcoming chaos of a PAS TASTA production.\nDespite the elevated star power, the collective hasn’t forgotten its roots. Fellow netlabel friends and rappers Jumadiba and Lil Soft Tennis hop on “byun G,” trading verses back and forth over the mangled backing track. They hold fast to the rhythm, keeping step as it descends into a madness of breakbeats. The group dig even deeper for “B.B.M.,” paying homage to their collective love of theVocaloidmusicians that influenced them. They chop up the computerized voice ofHatsune Miku—courtesy of veteran producerPinocchio-P—scattering it over a grimy baile funk beat. It’s a quintessentially PAS TASTA song as well as a bit of sly humor, referencing the viralart trendof drawing the Vocaloid idol as if she were from Brazil.\nMassive moments of triumph bookend the record. First full track “BULLDOZER+” and closer “The Car” go the hardest, stacking Uyama’s voice into a vocal-fried stadium anthem on the former and an angelic chorus on the latter. The outro fades on a wailing guitar solo, whichyuigot sayshe played so forcefully that most of the strings broke. PAS TASTA save their best for when outside collaborators are absent, showing their real strength comes from the synergy they’ve built. In the past year the group has transcended the Discord server, bringing their friendly competitioninto the fleshas they playfully elbow one another for control of the knobs.GRAND POPpresents a unified theory of J-pop, but that’s not necessarily PAS TASTA’s goal—they’re just chasing the sounds that excite them."

Consider the CIA front that, in 1961, sentNina Simoneoverseas for a concert in newly independent Nigeria. The high priestess of soul, famously fond of referring to her country as the “United Snakes of America,” had temporarily become a patsy in the war on communism. On “Black Opps,” the opening track of his new album,LOWER,Benjamin Bookerpays sneering homage to the U.S. government’s history of covertly undermining African American liberation. The message: This game wasn’t winnable then, and it certainly isn’t winnable now. Booker has seemingly spent the seven years since his last record swallowing down all the hopelessness and dread he could hold. Now he’s spitting it back up like bile.\nEven as it grappled with systemic racism and police brutality, 2017’sWitnesswas warm and hospitable; steeped in blues, soul, and R&B; all well-trod wood and candlelight; rich with the humid air of Booker’s adopted home of New Orleans. OnLOWER, night has fallen, and there’s a cold wind blowing. “Give a little love,” Booker croons—shivers, really. “They’ve bugged the house again/Give a little love, they’re on the lawn.” To make this record, he sought out producerKenny Segal, known for his work with rap acts likeArmand Hammerandbilly woods, and together they systematically drained Booker’s work of color, light, and heat—in a good way. “Black Opps” renders a hi-fi blast zone littered with 808 rubble. An irradiated guitar riff, both funereal and militant, accompanies Booker as he surveys the wreckage, delivering his black mass: “Hallelujah, dying fighting for a life I ain’t had yet.”\nSegal comes from underground hip-hop and Booker from retro-leaning rock’n’roll, butLOWERdoesn’t sound like any of those genres’ past collisions. Instead, it takes the basic textures of rap rock—boom-bap beats,Deftones’ icy ambiance, the corroded shredding of “She Watch Channel Zero?!”—and fashions them into a new strain of beat-centric grunge. Lead single “Lwa in the Trailer Park” submerges Booker’s voice in a pool of shoegaze that ripples around the steady pulse of a kick drum. Later in the album, “Same Kind of Lonely” features a provocative juxtaposition of samples: real audio from a school shooting, followed by the laugh of Booker’s baby daughter. Call it poor taste, but courtesy isn’t worth much when you’re living with the fear that one day, your child might not come home."

Anyone being nice 24/7 is hiding something.”\nIt’s in that vinegary spirit that Davis decided to put outSacrifice,released as Mean Bacharach and just as pugnacious and studio-enamored as his new moniker implies. This music was originally recorded in 2018, when the producer was a support act onFlying Lotus’s 3D-augmentedKuso-era tour. But its themes of self-improvement and score-settling may be truer to Davis’s life now, after years of battling depression and PTSD and struggling to get sober. “Funny it took falling to the depths of rock bottom to finally realize this project deserves to see light,” he said on Bandcamp.\nDavis usually makes deep, soulful vocal house, filled with pneumatic percussion, warm ’70s analog textures, and washes of garbled vocals. Here, he leans into abstract sound design, evoking wild auteurs likeShuggie Otis,McCartney II-eraPaulorWizard-eraTodd Rundgren, for whom pop was as much about instinct as craft. “No Doubt” emerges from an a capella wasteland of absent-minded dum-dums and bizarre tomcat growls. “Let’s Go To The Circus” sounds likeAmerie’s “1 Thing” melted into sewer sludge, while “Blacklist” sounds like it’s being played backwards, likely because it is. The songs are all around two or three minutes except the five-minute title track, which emerges as the album’s anthem despite featuring nothing more than bass, an unchanging drum loop, and Davis’s musings on a less-secure past self he’s happy to leave behind.\nDavis’s vitriol extends to childhood rivals (“High School Reunion”), noncommittal partners (“Lazy Lover,” with Brainfeeder producerMono/Poly), and fame-chasing solipsists (“15 Minutes”). But his contempt feels purposeful rather than recklessly cruel, as if he’s decided to cut out all the people he doesn’t need from his life and acknowledged that a little ruthlessness is healthy during such a transition. “High School Reunion” ends with Davis admitting his grudges are pointless and he might actually benefit more from trying to relate to his former tormentor than trying to punish him. Switch the sexes on “Lazy Lover” and you’d have “No Scrubs.”\nThe castigation of self-aggrandizing artists on “15 Minutes” comes with the subtext that being famous would suck, because you wouldn’t be able to put out an album likeSacrificewithout pissing people off. “A lot of [y’all] slept on my Mean Bacharach alias side project,” Davis tweeted; “you were supposed to.” The true mark of success,Sacrificeslyly implies, isn’t fame or fortune but having the option to release an album like this: ripe, uncompromising, and too grown-up to give a shit if the average listener likes it or not. Like a lot of pickled things, it’s an acquired taste."

OnPhantom Island, their 27th studio album, they lavish their gently trippy compositions with orchestral contributions. The results are occasionally frustrating, sometimes beautiful, and almost always interesting if not entirely lovable.\nWritten and recorded alongside last year’s fun and anarchicFlightb741,Phantom Islandwasn’t written or originally recorded with orchestral arrangements in mind. But, realizing first mixes felt unfinished, and having recently met members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic backstage after a show, the band saw an opportunity for yet another experiment. Inspired by the Philharmonic’s sound, they sent mixdowns to the British conductor Chad Kelly, who wrote elaborate arrangements for the songs and assembled a group of musicians to dub over the original tracks in the studio.\nThat inbuilt incongruity sometimes makes for enjoyable tension. The louche horns on the title-track opener, for example, call back impressively to the golden age of Blaxploitation soundtracks—even if they’re entirely at odds with the daydreamy verses and final-third freak-out. The violins and flutes on “Sea of Doubt” sound weightless and intoxicating at first, though eventually they distract from some of Stu Mackenzie and Joey Walker’s best country-rock guitars. The lush strings on “Eternal Return” are reminiscent ofMorcheeba’s “The Sea”; the theatrical bass vocals and sax solos elsewhere on the song may as well be from another universe.\nWhen the disparate worlds of psychedelia and orchestra do cohere, there are little sparks of magic. The bombastic rock ‘n’ soul of “Deadstick” comes to gleefully chaotic life with a made-for-TV horn section, and “Panpsych” opens with a simple solo flute and a playful guitar before collapsing into a delicious groove. Lucas Harwood’s bass coils itself around the orchestra so deftly on theRevolver-esque “Aerodynamic,” it’s difficult to imagine one without the other. Kelly’s arrangements seem designed to helpPhantom Islandtake flight, like a series of carefully crafted propellers. “If I could have one wish, I’d turn my hands into wings,” Mackenzie sings on “Aerodynamic,” in what could easily bePhantom Island’sguiding axiom.\nStill, those moments are fleeting. Often the songs feel overstuffed, with great moments discarded in a hurry to get to something less worthwhile. “Lonely Cosmos” is gorgeous in its stripped-back form, with an acoustic guitar, a viola, and Mackenzie singing about drifting out into space on a potentially eternal mission; it did not need to become a jazz-funk odyssey. “Silent Spirit” has a great country-fried rock song buried under falsetto pronouncements that “time is eating its last meal.” King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have earned a cult fanbase that’s followed them through weirder territory than this while keeping weed dealers in business across the English-speaking world. Jumping from thought to thought and probing at squishy hallucinogenic ideas is a feature here, not a bug.\nBut at their best, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard can engage with enormous science-fiction concepts without drifting from the psychedelic into the obtuse. The best song onPhantom Island,“Spacesick,” is a five-minute mini-opus that takes flight mostly because it maintains its focus. It succeeds where perhaps only two other songs in history have before, expressing (and wielding as metaphor) the unique pathos of watching the earth rise from space. While it may not have the grand, balladic melodies of “Rocket Man” or “Space Oddity,” it does balance an intergalactic ambition with a wit and melody that less skilled songwriters would quickly discard. The crescendoing horns and graceful strings are integral, opening the song up into widescreen. If Mackenzie had been distracted by some nearby shooting star, he might never have come up with a line as poignant as his sign-off there: “To sit on chairs that touch the floor/For that, I'd give it all/Till then, dreaming's all I can do/I love you, over, Stu.”Phantom Islandis freewheeling and ambitious, and mostly admirable for it. Pared back slightly, it might have been truly absorbing.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Confidence Man’s mission: to get everyone dancing again. The group’s third album,3AM (LA LA LA), is their most serious record—if you can consider anything they do to be serious. This time, there are fewer lyrical winks and nudges, and more reliance on the transcendence of the all-night rager. The songs are sweatier, the band is sloshed, and the album’s sound aligns with club genres popular in the U.K. in the ’80s and ’90s: think acid house, trance, and 2-step.3AMhas plenty of floor-fillers, but the album’s repetitive second half might have you ready to ditch the party before the lights come up.\nVocalists Janet Planet and Sugar Bones claim to have made much of the album at the appointed time while under the influence (call it method recording).3AMhas the feel of the final hour before last call, courtesy of mask-wearing producers Reggie Goodchild and Clarence McGuffie. There’s an everlastinguntz untz, snippets of the kinds of conversations with strangers that seem to happen over a cigarette (and/or on MDMA), and lyrics that don’t pretend to make any sense. The wall-knocking metallic synths of “Control” are as sticky as theclub juiceon the soles of your slouchy boots.\nThe bacchanal starts before you hit play. Opener “Who Knows What You’ll Find?” fades in as if you’re walking into a rave that’s been bumping since last week. In this mode, the band relies on tried and true house elements; the squirrely synth and pronounced four-on-the-floor rhythm is extremely reminiscent of the French touch classic “Music Sounds Better With You.” If Stardust’s sleek hit considered how a special someone can make anything seem rosy, Confidence Man get a little murkier, asking an old flame to come back to the dancefloor for one last kiss (and a light).\nConfidence Man aren’t as likely to give you a toothache as Eurodance acts like Toy-Box or Vengaboys, but eventually3AMbegins to lose steam. Penultimate track “Wrong Idea” is already one of the least exciting, but its brooding atmospherics, big EDM drop, and Planet’s chanting sing-talk about living in the moment is nearly the same as an earlier song, the 9-to-5 sendoff “So What.” Neither track feels particularly well-distinguished. Other times, the band’s pastiche will have you itching for the original item. Sugar Bones-led “Sicko” is a virtual reproduction ofNine Inch Nails’ “Closer” down to the trip-hop ambiance, scuzzy synthesizer, and amplified angst: “I’m talking to God/I’m breakin’ the law,” Bones groans. As the tracks bleed together, exhaustion sets in."

That’s the driving force behindMIKE’s latest project, the incisive, extraordinaryShowbiz!It’s a portrait of a young man’s complicated search for a place to hang his hat, a quarter-life catharsis that’s both eager and apprehensive to approach the crossroads. The existential questions that have been a trademark of his work since 2017 remain, but there’s also a newfound, fire-seasoned wisdom: “Be patient, it ain’t every race that you lead,” he raps on “Then we could be free…”\nMIKE spent his childhood shuffling between New Jersey, London, Philadelphia, and New York City, but home was always his mother, Anuoluwapo Sandra Akinboboye. The two shared a deep bond, and when she passed away in early 2019, MIKE plumbed the depths of his grief, trying to figure out where and to whom he belonged. In his early twenties, he forged a community with his label and collective 10k, and gained a legion of adoring followers (one appears at the end of “Da Roc” to express his love for MIKE: “Full glaze. I don’t care if I’m glazing,” he testifies). At this point in his career, MIKE spends chunks of each year on tour and devotes his time in New York to writing and recording. It’s a rambling life, one that weighs friendly faces in every city against the nagging anticipation of constant change.\nStarting with 2022’sBeware of the Monkey, MIKE began uncurling. His music started to sound more assured, and by 2024’sPinball, a full-length collaboration with producerTony Seltzer, he was rapping with a fire in his belly, trading heartfelt examinations of depression for songs full of swagger and self-confidence.Showbiz!largely follows that path but tones down the fervor. MIKE’s raw immediacy is still there—most songs don’t have more than one verse—but this is not a step back into the shadows so much as a mindful reset. He roots himself in the here and now, treasuring every fleeting moment. “While you have it, you should cherish that/You won’t get it back,” he advises on “Lucky.” There’s a synthesis of his distinct modes, oscillating between delicate moments of presence, wherein MIKE analyzes his dreams or prays for peace, fleeting dips into depression, and blasts of triumphant, grinning shit-talk.Showbiz!celebrates that complexity, acknowledging that softness and strength often reinforce one another."

    "review_text": "As acertain IKEA couch will tell you, it’s notoriously complicated for queer people in heteronormative relationships to express their identity. If you’reMiya Folick, you dedicate your third album,Erotica Veronica,to navigating that very neurosis. While dating a cis man, Folick developed a record that honored the sides of herself not present with her partner. Fitting a more introspective album, she deviated from her previous production-heavy records and recorded live with a variety of Los Angeles musicians like Meg Duffy ofHand HabitsandPerfume Geniuscollaborator Greg Uhlmann.Erotica Veronicatries to integrate all her disparate longings and experiences into a unified whole. The insular, small-scale sound and songwriting holds the record back from truly being the “psychosensual masterstroke” described in press materials, though it’s often fascinating in its own right.\nThe album’s concept peaks in its opening moments. On “Erotica,” Folick thinks about flirting with women on the street; on “La Da Da,” she confesses to her loving stoner boyfriend that she has “sapphic fantasies” while they’re in bed together. There’s no thought for how a woman might react to flirtation from someone already committed, little consideration for how the guy must feel when his girlfriend yearns for something he can’t provide—Folick’s pure id makes these songs so captivating. They are gorgeous but uncomfortable, quietly revelling in small transgressions atop dreamy, reverberating choruses.\nThe rest of the album can’t maintain that intrigue, lapsing into vague cosmic imagery on “Prism of Light” and “Hypergiant” (“The glow of your spirit/Is a hypergiant/And it smiles with defiant happiness”);Erotica Veronicais best by far when developing the themes of its opening tracks. On “Hate Me,” Folick realizes she’s losing herself in relationships no matter what gender she dates, and speaks up: “Spill me on concrete/Throw me in grass/Just let me keep my name.” The introspection gives would-be clichés more weight, like the dramatic irony of Folick telling an avoidant lover that “you’re one half with me and one half missing” on “This Time Around,” knowing a big piece of her is missing in the relationship, too.\nThe straightforward production is at odds with the genuinely complex sentiments. This is intentional: In search of a no-frills rock album, Folick stripped back the eccentricities of 2018’sPremonitionsand 2023’s more low-keyRoach. Erotica Veronicadraws from a more limited set of influences, most notably the earthy folk-rock ofBig Thiefand the shimmery wistfulness ofthe Cranberries, and the album doesn’t deviate much from Cranberry Thief. Without Folick’s usual vocal acrobatics, a pleasantly uptempo song like “Alaska” doesn’t separate itself enough from contemporariesSamiaor,inevitably,Maggie Rogers. It’s not until penultimate track “Love Wants Me Dead” that the album fully lets loose, with a searing guitar solo from Mal Hauser that finally reflects the lyrical angst."

    "review_text": "Yves Jarvis’ relationship with songwriting is akin to a sommelier testing wine—he’s perpetually drunk on melody, yet he savours each one just long enough to register a brief blissful taste before moving onto the next. Unlike noted data-dump tunesmiths likeRobert Pollard, Jarvis isn’t on a mission to flood the market; rather, he’s motivated by the challenge of seeing how much he can pack into a two-minute track. His music strikes a lot of familiar chords—late-’60s psych-folk, sundazed early-’70s soul, lo-fi ’80s funk—and yet, even as he projects a deceptively chill vibe, Jarvis is always daring you to keep up. Listening to his songs is like navigating a Ouija board: the playing field is defined, but you never know which way the planchette is going to slide. As he explained in arecent interview, “I love boundaries. It’s easier to experiment within boundaries.”\nBut for this fifth album, the experiment was to not experiment. As the title suggests,All Cylindersis the sound of Yves Jarvis going for it: He’s letting his melodies breathe, he’s working with clearly delineated verses and choruses, and he’s no longer hiding behind the haze. In defiance of his usual collagist tendencies, randomized arrangements, and vaporous vocals, Jarvis has been dropping names likeFrank Sinatra, Jackson Browne, andJohn Mayeras guiding lights for the record.\nYou can hear that sharper focus take effect in real time on the opening “With a Grain”: For its first 45 seconds, the song floats off in a splendorous cocktail-jazz daydream, before a sound like a ringing phone snaps Jarvis out of his reverie and straps him to a taut, strutting backbeat. The first words we hear him sing are, “Everything I say/Take it with a grain,” a caveat easily applied to his stated intentions for the record. As it turns out, Jarvis isn’t so much swinging for the big leagues as creating his own version of another personal touchstone,McCartney II, by adopting the mindset of a decorated auteur working with limited means, and placing equal emphasis on the craft and the quirks. One moment, he’s concocting handclap-happy West Coast pop like a one-manHaim(“Decision Tree”); the next, he’s firing off two crashing guitar chords in brief succession and calling it a song (the 14-second “Patina”).\nAll Cylindersis a DIY affair through and through—not only did Jarvis lay down every vocal and instrumental track himself, he recorded the album directly into the open-source software Audacity while couch-surfing in Montreal and L.A. As a result, even the album’s most tightly executed songs retain a homespun feel. On “The Knife in Me,” Jarvis steps out and gets down in the discotheque of his dreams, but the gleam of the mirror ball suddenly gives way to the glow of a campfire, as if flipping sides on some imaginaryToro y Moi/Fleet Foxessplit 7\". Once the beat drops out partway through, what began as a frisky funk track about a metaphorical backstabbing suddenly transforms into a folksy account of bleeding to death."

    "review_text": "The DMV’s street rap sound becomes more apocalyptic by the week. Possessed rappers likeSkino,Slimegetem, andAC640have turned the rapid, drill-inspired DMV flow into a seance;mad scientist producers—Trapmoneybiggie, ehuncho6, and Dolan Beatz, to name a few—wield avalanche drums that hit like they were made withCam’ron’sConfessions of Firesledgehammer. Well, scratch that. While damn near everyone else is soundtracking the end of days,KP Skywalka, one of the scene’s new-generation stars, is busy updating his sex diary. His Skinemax-worthy new tape,4 Tha Freakas, is a hilariously vivid, nasty-as-hell collection of steamy boner raps.\nSince breaking out less than two years ago, KP Skywalka, who is in his early twenties, has been a rapper of many modes. He can lay down wistful corner boy memories (2022’sGrandma House), act the loverboy (2023’sSoutheast Love Story), or join in on the doomsday vibe so popular in his city (last year’sFree Car Pistol). But he’s a storyteller at heart, drawing easy-to-visualize scenes full of realistic characters without losing the loose, punched-in style of the shot-out-of-a-cannon DMV flow. It just so happens that on4 Tha Freakasthat meticulousness applies to tales of spit-swapping and wig-pulling. KP is so deep into his dirty flings that it’s basically novelistic. He notes what music is playing in the background (Drake, Ginuwine,Tink), where they get busy (on “On Her Face,” they go from the shower to the bed and end up knocking out on the couch), and how the post-coital argument started: “She tell me ‘It’s good and it’s sweet’/How we get on this?/She was goin’ through my phone in my sleep,” he raps on the conversational “Say My Grace.” There’s not a detail left to the imagination, though I could do with less cum splattering.\nDespite KP’s X-rated player’s ball,4 Tha Freakasgets an air of romance from the jiggy beats, almost all done by local producer Travagant (with help from Efosa Beloved and Profound Beats). They’re all groovy flips of tender ’90s R&B ballads, punched up by the stuttering, go-go-infused bounce. Standouts, like the synthy “Cracking Her Back” and dreamy “Feel Right,” turn KP’s horndogging into sensual lovemaking, like one of those softly erotic ’80s music videos with gentle touches and sweaty close-ups. It helps that the women he’s with feel like more than faceless conquests—they’re relationships with their own dynamics. There’s the one on “Morgan State,” who goes to the titular college and seems to be attracted to a guy with a past. There’s the 30-year-old ex-stripper on “Poppin the Pole” who’s just passing the time with him. On a short but funny interlude, he picks up a call from a girlfriend named Tay. She labels him a “weird ass” after hearing that his next mixtape is called4 Tha Freakas. The moment ends with them exchanging “I love yous.”\nBut KP Skywalka is such a direct narrator that 12 tracks of “fucking” and “swallowing” and “eating” can get pretty repetitive. A few sex metaphors would go a long way! That doesn’t kill the fun of4 Tha Freakas, though, which makes up for monotony with vignettes that feel alive: the woman sexting him while she’s at work, the woman that locks her legs around him because she wants a baby. When it’s done with this much attention to detail, there’s always room for a rapper on aNice & Smooth-stylefilthy romp—even in the hell-raising DMV rap scene of 2025."

    "review_text": "To listen to earlySaint Etiennerecords is to be taken over by the promise of youth: the sound of three wide-eyed arrivals to the big city making the most of their pop dreams. The joy of Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs’ production stems from its refusal of simple escapism, charting a clever, side-winding path where slice-of-life charm runs parallel to outré pop fantasy. Obsolete or half-imagined zones likeFinisterre,Tiger Bay, andFoxbase Alphamapped onto the real-life texture of the Home Counties, West Country, and London itself. Sarah Cracknell leverages the easy intimacy of her voice to navigate the highs and lows of this sometimes-vivid, sometimes-cardboard scenery, her glamorous, comforting presence leading the way through Wiggs and Stanley’s fireworks.\nBut time has a pitiless way of telescoping out, and you could almost cry at the band’s era-specific optimism and the lost world that inspired it: London still welcoming and affordable, the UK still a part of Europe, ecstasy and Concorde flights and Englishness as sources of breezy pride rather than vein-bursting reaction. “When you’re 20 or 21,” Cracknell intones with an unmistakable grain in her voice on the opening track of the group’s 11th studio album,The Night, “You have so much energy and belief.” One might read the song’s title, “Settle In,” two ways: as a rainy evening at home, or as waiting out the rest of your life. OnThe Night, Saint Etienne temper their boundless imagination with a sense of finality and adult knowingness, keeping the fire glowing with a full awareness of the fast-approaching cold and dark.\nThe Nightfeels like an extension and refinement of the downbeat melancholy of 2021’sI’ve Been Trying to Tell You. That record, which wove sleepy dub production and elliptical samples into mournful circles, dwelled on repetition without ever fully articulating the obvious sadness at its center. In contrast,The Night’s pivot toward ambient music dovetails with a deep world-weariness. Stanley and Wiggs evoke nocturnal scenes with an ear for creepy resonance, foregrounding the creaks, aches, and eerie frequencies that go unheard during the day. Their palette is both detailed and impressionist, conjuring a dense fog and studding it with place-markers that flicker and recede along with the music. On “Through the Glass” and “Northern Counties East,” the group soundtrack a patter of never-ending rainfall, rounding out the gloom with found percussion, pained harpsichord, and subdued guitar. At times the murk is so dense, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’d put onThe Caretakeror a latter-dayBurialrecord."

    "review_text": "Horsebath, a good band in possession of a bad name, give fair warning in the first song off their debut album: “It’s hard to love, hard to love, hard to love me,” goes the repeated refrain. A later lyric admits understanding “the weakness of a moving man,” referring to the ways the band’s heavy touring schedule disrupts relationships, romantic or otherwise. It might sound presumptuous or even aspirational for a band to fill its debut with songs about rootlessness and the road, as though the quintet might actually be looking forward to all those good-byes and all those long drives. But Horsebath has been rambling around Canada for a few years now, putting thousands of miles on the odometer as they’ve defined a distinctive balance of rambunctious barroom energy and rootsy, open-plains melodicism.Another Farewellis an album whose outsize musical palette—weird cowboy songs, streamlined saloon rockers, big-hearted folk tracks, pastoral psychedelia—is rooted in their wanderlust.\nPlaying songs about roaming, Horsebath make no bones about gesturing toward other artists who’ve played songs about roaming. They venerateThe Band, of course, but alsoNeil Young, the Buckaroos,Hank Williams, and the International Submarine Band, and they ignore the skeletonframesofburned-outbandswho’ve driven these same highways. “In the Shade” has more than a bit ofGram Parsons’ cosmic country sound, but Horsebath find unexpected ways to convey spaciness, primarily by filling every empty space with swirls of ominous organ chords. It all makes the chorus—“I run from the sun and I hide in the shade”—sound that much more haunted, like Mutter is crawling out of a dark hole.\nBecause the road so closely informs the music they play, Horsebath can’t help but romanticize their own wanderings, andAnother Farewell’s spry twang and imaginative arrangements make for a rip-roaring road trip record. You can hear as much in the barrelhouse piano that counts the highway lines on “Hard to Love” and the tentative strums that festoon the high-lonesome waltz “Don’t Know What It Is.” They play theClash-style “Train to Babylon” like they’ve caught a glimpse of calamity in the rearview mirror: “This train ain’t bound for glory,” they harmonize, simultaneously inflating and puncturing the romance of the road. There’s a fraught, even desperate quality to their travels, as though they can’t stop running, and that compulsion generates excitement and rumination in equal measure.\nHorsebath find inspiration in that ambivalence, which allows them to carve out a distinctive niche in roots music. “Never Be Another You” opens with a lengthy instrumental passage that sounds like theVenturestrying to surf in Bakersfield, then transforms into aStonesyrocker. The two ideas are jammed together into one song, but the players savor the friction of so many tempo changes and stylistic rugpulls. With its jazzy melody, languid strums, and brushed snare, “Only in My Dreams” could be a late-’60s cover of a tune from some lost Depression-era musical, and closer “Turn My Lover Loose” hinges on a go-go organ vamp that suggests they’ve got aSir Douglas Quintet8-track stuck in the dash. It’s a curious finale. You might expect a road trip narrative to end on an emotionally climactic note that signals personal growth or a change in perspective. Instead, to Horsebath’s credit, they wrap things up with a rowdy rave-up that fades out as they drive off into the sunset. It’s not an end to their journey, but a cliffhanger hinting at more exploits to come.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Voice Actor’s music buzzes like a brain. It vibrates, oscillates, turns strange stimuli into electrical waves. Their 2022 albumSent From My Telephonesometimes felt less like music than neural entrainment: a gargantuan sketchbook, nearly four and a half hours long, blending spoken-word poetry, distorted samples, and noirish drones. That epic transmission confirmed Voice Actor—originally the duo of Noa Kurzweil and Levi Lanser, who left the group before the album’s release—as one of the most mysterious acts on Belgian’s outsider-music label Stroom. Now Kurzweil has teamed up withSquu—an obscure Welsh producer who has released 39 songs onBandcampover the past four years; most of hisSoundCloudstreams are in the low single digits—onLust (1), a more concentrated shot of sensual ambient with soft gestures of two-step and downbeat dub. It sustains the sublime and keeps it in abeyance like a long, drawn-out orgasm. This is music of a primitive, delirious, and delightfully exhausted state.\nAcross the album’s 45 minutes, Squu’s lustrous pads spread out horizontally, blushing like wine, while Kurzweil voice commands a remote and romantic authority. It’s an unlikely harmony.Lust (1)glimmers with melodic rapture even when it’s jolted by metallic clangs and percussive glitches or by Kurzweil’s oaky consonation. Vague ambience and gritty details complement rather than negate each other: the metallic birdsong meeting low bass drones on “You,” or the syncopated clicks falling in with the heavenly arpeggio of “Rattle.” With each small inflection of timbre and breath, a powerful shift in mood.\nThe album gracefully alternates between floaty ambient sketches and well-whetted pulses. “dYn,” with its deconstructed swing, sounds like the inside of a marathon runner’s faltering lungs, while “Fields” simply sighs along with its sweet, beatless motif and atonal embellishments. But even in its vaguest and most abstract moments,Lust (1)possesses sharp expressive powers. It impresses like a bruise of unsure origin. Despite the centrality of words, it resists meaning. It mimics that state of good sex when thresholds explode and all logic flushes out. Kurzweil renders words tactile, onomatopoeic. Her voice is largely unintelligible, often mixed very low, yet even when she articulates more clearly, her words still retain a soupy quality. “Your hands around my neck,” she repeats coolly on two-stepper “Nekk,” thekreverberating and bubbling like yonic clicks, a kind of gynecological ASMR. Kurzweil forfeits meaning to phonemes, making her abstractions glow even more keenly.\nLust (1)follows the narrative arc of a slowly depixelating image, and anything even approaching language, logic, or clarity only begins to gather by the last song. On “Barbara,” the album’s outro, Kurzweil speaks for the first time in full sentences with clear, unambiguous meanings. What does she have to say for herself? “Barbara Walters was a condescending, ignorant, arrogant snob,” she intones, referencingWalters’ antagonistic interview with Dolly Partonin 1977. It’s the kind of thing someone says aloud exactly halfway between REM states and waking: logically sound but contextually absurd. That’s the sort of register needed, Kurzweil and Squu have found, to convey the essence of dreams. It’s a mode of communication beyond words."

The irrational belief that plexiglass partitions could fend off the COVID-19 virus as we dined indoors, as if swirling, microscopic vapor particles would halt and retreat like obedient soldiers. Welater learnedthat breath aerosols simply wind around these barriers, drifting like cigarette smoke, partition be damned.\nAmid the pandemic, and because of it, Norwegian avant-garde artistJenny Hvalconsidered less nefarious vapors. As live performances became a public health liability, Hval revived her teenage fascination with perfume, and christened her ninth albumIris Silver Mistafter a belovedscent of the same name. The $320 fragrance from French company Serge Lutens, crafted in the mid-1990s by renowned nose Maurice Roucel, has been called “the powderiest, rootiest, most sinister iris imaginable,” as scent authority Luca Turinput itin his five-star review. For Hval, the perfume evokes the stages of its making: an alchemic transformation from plant matter to glorious vapor; a “flower that is a root that has died, been resurrected and finely grated,” as she has described it. The 13 songs indebted to this scent examine such grand states of flux: between present and past, tactile and intangible.\nOf all the liminalities Hval mines onIris Silver Mist, the most intriguing and prevalent is performance itself. On the sauntering “I don’t know what free is,” Hval questions the definition of creative practice: “I tried to ask ‘What is a performance?’/What is to write?” she sings, her clean falsetto arching over synthesized organ thrums, threatening to vanish at any moment. The earthier “All night long,” with its skeletal percussion and rippling, fingerpicked guitar, portrays performance as the ultimate expression of existence: “As long as I’m performing I am not choosing, or dying/I am performing in the speed of light,” Hval says, speaking softly but plainly. Following this revelation, the song opens into a cosmic jazz refrain, and Hval demonstrates an even purer act of performance: nonverbal singing that mirrors the melody with the unfettered charm of a child humming to a car radio.\nImpermanence is a threat and a delight acrossIris Silver Mist. “Instruments packed/The stage lights are cut/The beer you just spilled on the floor has dried out,” she sings on “The gift”; like perfume, the spilled beer changes over time, once fresh and now sticky and stale. On “The artist is absent,” the record’s clubbiest number, Hval sings in a register so high her words are almost indecipherable. She warns of “a stage without a show/A hazy silhouette… A club without a club” atop gritty synths and a driving beat that collapses into a tangle of distortion. An ambient hiss seeps into the following song, “Huffing my arm,” where Hval murmurs with sibilance as shoes clomp on wooden floorboards; one imagines shehasslipped into some less corporeal realm. There is no way to decipher who is wandering the empty halls and who is haunting them."

They think and feel.They have insides.“But, O Lord,” he narrates to himself, “not such an inside as mine.” On “Baton,” the closing track toModel/Actriz’s second album,Pirouette,Cole Hadenhas a similar revelation in reverse. While talking to his sister, he realizes that she has memories of him that he does not share. There’s a version of him in her head that doesn’t overlap perfectly with how he perceives himself. Suddenly there are two Coles. Then, by extension, because Haden is the singer of a band whose first album did quite well for itself, suddenly there arenColes: one for everyone who’s ever perceived him. All these selves multiply and spin away from him, uncontrollable.\nAs far as follow-ups to raw, brilliant debuts go,Pirouetteis strikingly honest about its own self-consciousness. The Brooklyn quartet’s 2023 album,Dogsbody, stormed hot out of the gate, sending lyrics about gay abjection flailing over squalls of cathartic noise. Now firmly established, Model/Actriz follows with an album deeply concerned with being seen and calibrating one’s image in service of pursuing desire. Rather than raucous and eruptive, the music is now icy, clipped, and clean, a step away fromEinstürzende Neubautenand towardCrystal CastlesandCircus-eraBritney. It still has teeth, but they are oh-so-white.\nButPirouetteis more than the sound of a band strutting while the cameras flash. Haden’s lyrics root into early memories of self-censure, when he intuited as a very young child that his queerness was too dangerous to be celebrated or even shared. On “Cinderella,” over harmonics that blare like an emergency siren, he sings about the time when, at age five, he almost asked for a Cinderella-themed birthday party. “And when the moment came and I changed my mind/I was quiet, alone, and devastated.” Even now, in adulthood, that internalized rejection stings his drive for intimacy. Being out, generally speaking, is one thing; opening yourself up to another person in your fullness is another.\nThroughout the record, Haden chases himself through a mirror maze, startling at his own reflection as he tries to slither his way out into reality. On “Departures,” he prays to a scattered personal pantheon to realize his own embodiment, to become flesh instead of reflected light. “Diva” finds him meeting men out in European clubs and bemoaning that he has no way to take them home—a logistical problem standing in for a spiritual vacancy. It’s here that he sneers his way through one of his most perplexing couplets: “You could call me a small business owner/Living in America, while trapped in the body of an operatic diva.” He’s nodding, maybe, to the eternal tension between art and commerce, the harrowing compromise of selling one’s deepest shames for penny streams, but the wording is so explosive that the point disappears in the muzzle flash."

    "review_text": "Along the wild western coast of Ireland’s County Galway lies Connemara. Oscar Wilde once praised the region’s “savage beauty,” a phrase you will encounter at least a dozen times reading about its rugged expanses of mountain, bog, lake, and sea, to all of which its 30,000 or so residents appear proudly subordinate. Hovering the place on Google Maps takes you over craggy ranges and flowering heath, coral beaches and tiny fishing villages, ruins of castles and nunneries straight out of Gothic romance novels. Here the modern world bears a striking resemblance to the ancient world of myth.\nMaria Somervillehas described her debut album, 2019’sAll My People, as a subconscious expression of a deep longing for home. The Irish musician wrote those songs—vague slips of murky slowcore that drew fromGrouper’s muted drone-pop and the Irish folk ballads her uncles used to sing in pubs—while living in Dublin, where she had moved for school. But all the while she felt the pull of Connemara, where she was born and raised, and where she finally returned in 2020. Moving into a combination home and studio on the edge of Lough Corrib (the second-largest lake in Ireland), Somerville settled into a quieter way of life, which included regular walks through the windswept countryside and conversations with her father, a retired fisherman who shared with her the secrets of the trade, like the way a certain shimmer on the rocks portends rain. I wonder if it was a secret to her neighbors that Somerville had signed a deal with 4AD, or hosted a twice-weeklyNTS showwhere she whispered morning greetings over gentle selections fromLaraaji,Yo La Tengo,Durutti Column,Low, overlaid with field recordings of the rush of wind and sea.\nWritten and recorded during her time in Connemara, Somerville’s second album and first for 4AD,Luster, feels like an evolutionary leap akin to that ofCocteau TwinsbetweenBlue Bell KnollandHeaven or Las Vegas; the first was pretty, the second is sublime. Through a dense mist of shoegaze, post-punk, and ambient electronics, Somerville presents a dreamworld that is both mythic and real, a wild and ancient landscape in which her own figure is just barely perceptible. At the same time, you might consider it a deft and sweeping survey of all that “dream pop” can encompass—drawing lines fromMazzy StartoMy Bloody ValentinetoBroadcasttoJulianna Barwick, settling comfortably alongside the masterpieces of the canon."

    "review_text": "Christian Fenneszhas become famous for a very different kind of guitar music than he grew up with. But the Austrian glitch icon never forgot the feeling of being a kid and having your mind blown by the right song at the right time: hearing a Deep Purple riff and feeling ten feet tall, maybe being a little older and hearingPet SoundsandSmileand understanding how pop can be used in pursuit of transcendence. He’slonginvokedthe Beach Boysas a muse;Endless Summer, his 2001 masterpiece, shares its name with the band’s 1974 greatest-hits comp, and its wounding chord changes and symphonic grandeur dovetailed with a Y2K-era moment when hipsters were discoveringBrian WilsonandBurt Bacharachand an arranger was suddenly the sexiest thing to be.\nThat ideal of starry-eyed genius is less fashionable now than when Fennesz began his career, and Fennesz’s own approach has evolved to become more workmanlike. His eighth album,Mosaic, is the result of a process he describes as a “9 to 5,” a steady working ritual that entails a committed daily practice followed by long hours of editing. This process also resulted in 2019’sAgora,a highlight of his career that situated his undeniable ear for harmony in a more stripped-back context. These six tracks simmer his sound down even further, and though his instrument is usually unrecognizable,Mosaicis the closest thing to a “guitar album” he’s put out since 2008’sBlack Sea. It feelsplayed,not arranged.\nThe slides and sweeps that define Fennesz’s sound have always given away their source, even when his effects burble like a thousand voices. OnMosaic,you can hear the guitarist’s physical labor more clearly than ever. The solemn downstrokes on “Heliconia” sound like they were recorded through a tin-can telephone, but they still land with the heroic force of a heavy rock power chord. The astonishing swells at the end of “Patterning Heart” sound as much like a church bell as an ’80s post-punk attempt at imitating a church bell—maybe an isolated track fromThe Unforgettable FireorDisintegration.The pneumatic ribbons of guitar on “Personare” sound like air slowly being let out of a balloon, but anyone with a shred of familiarity with how the instrument works can picture the exact motion up the neck required to make the sound."

    "review_text": "Kendrick Lamarcan freeze time by surprise-dropping an album because he’s one of the most popular rappers of the century, which is nothing short of a miracle. There aren’t too many albums out there as theatrical as the coming-of-age breakout albumgood kid, m.A.A.d cityor the jazz-infused organized chaos ofTo Pimp a Butterfly. And shit, if there are, they definitely aren’t platinum-selling pop culture behemoths. Those early projects shaped his mythos, formed his supposed “genius,” and in an era of increasing ephemerality, had enough heft to become indispensable.\nFascinatingly, 2022’sMr. Morale and the Big Steppersattempted to strip away all the institutional recognition of the first and only rapper to win a Pulitzer. That project is far from my favorite Kendrick, but the music is so raw and uncomfortable, so provocative and sincere, so full of contradictions and hypocrisies. In a moment where our biggest rap stars and legends—Drake,Jay,Kanye,Snoop, whoever—have basically become institutions of their own, in which music is just one department of the enterprise,Mr. Morale’s naked humanity was genuinely risky and exciting.\nLess interesting, but anall-time spectacle, was his hating-ass feud with Drake. It’s where the contradictions and hypocrisies that previously made him so real suddenly felt unusually self-interested and corporatized. He whooped Drake by labeling the Toronto kingpin a “freaky-ass nigga,” a “pedophile,” and a hip-hop interloper using regional rap scenes to build his authenticity, all on arguably thebiggest rap songof the decade so far. It was hard as hell, a club-ready rendition of his hometown player sound dripping with radioactive bile. But from the jump, it was transparent that Kendrick, who hadKodak Blackup and downMr. Moraleand has always been a close collaborator ofDr. Dre, wasn’t actually concerned about claiming the moral high ground. It was all dirt to shovel on Drake’s grave, before Kendrick rode away with the title of greatest rapper of his era. Fine, I guess. Rap beef can be messed up.\nThen, as time passed and the meaning of “Not Like Us,” which could always be fairly interpreted as a celebration of Black L.A. culture, became commodified (fromKamala Harristothe NBA), Kendrick’s angle shifted—sublty leaning into the savior complex, the mythmaking, the branding he resisted onMr. Morale. In September, he released a buzzkill single called “Watch the Party Die,” where his mission moved past Drake and toward burning the rotten core of the hip-hop industry to the ground. He portrayed himself like Clint Eastwood’s disillusioned fugitive inThe Outlaw Josey Wales, riding through the West on horseback looking for revenge on the corrupt."

    "review_text": "Around the time thatAddison Raebroke a million TikTok followers in the fall of 2019, the platform offered a system update for the American dream; now all that was required to claim a better, richer life was a phone, some free time, and a willingness to perform air traffic control dances with a smile. For those not on the app, your introduction to the social media star may have been her 2021Tonight Showdebut, a chipper showing, not exactly screaming “star power,” which confirmed my worst assumptions about where youth culture was headed. Rae, who grew up a competitive dancer and later, a cheerleader, brought to the app not just girl-next-door sweetness, but also ruthless pragmatism and a tireless work ethic. On a recentpodcast, the 24-year-old performer spoke insightfully of her time in the viral dance mines. “When I reflect back on that time, I’ve recognized how much choice and taste is kind of a luxury,” she noted without shame, summing up her methodology as: “How am I going to get out of here?”\nBy “here” she meant Lafayette, Louisiana, where her dashed dreams of dancing for the LSU Tiger Girls had nearly given way to the grim prospect of small-town normalcy. A couple hours away was Kentwood, the hometown ofBritney Spears, a fellow born entertainer whose precocious talents were both a refuge from family chaos and an ostensible ticket out. Since Rae reintroduced herself as a fledgling pop star—first with 2021’s “Obsessed,” the kitschy lead single from her scrapped debut album, then a slew of leaked demos which sparked her transformation from cheesy striver to cult favorite—Spears has loomed large on her mood board viapap walk,video Easter egg, and a breathless reverence for earthy, girlish glam. But since last year, when Rae threw herself into the role of pop diva with surprising wit and moxie, what has mostly come to mind is Spears’ reminder thata job is a job: “You want a Lamborghini? Sip martinis? Look hot in a bikini? You better work, bitch.”\nRae’s debut album,Addison, floats in on a swell of goodwill following a string of improbably great singles, each one a little weirder than the last. Last August’s effervescent “Diet Pepsi” felt a bit like earlyLanain the star-spangled coquetry of its parking lot romance. But where Del Rey sang her torch songs with cool resignation, Rae’s layered vocals seemed to buzz with woozy warmth, punctuated here and there with “Ahh!”s of satisfaction. Its followup, “Aquamarine,” has grown on me since fall—a four-on-the-floor siren song which eagerly begged comparison toMadonna’sRay of LightorKylie Minogue’sFever. The moody minor chords of February’s “High Fashion” were less primed for the charts than for a cuddle puddle at an after-hours flophouse. And there was poignance in the downcast trip-hop of fourth single “Headphones On,” which faced the doldrums with a cigarette and a stiff upper lip. In the video, Rae pops in a pair of wired earbuds and is whisked off from her day job to a manic pixie dream world."

    "review_text": "“i seek another dimension in music,” the trumpeterWadada Leo Smithwrote in his 1973 booknotes (8 pieces) source a new world music: creative music. Like an astrophysicist, he discovered that time is malleable—not the neutral medium in which a piece develops, but an integral part of the composition. Time is expressed through what Smith calls “space/silence,” which he deploys with an expert hand that makes each note, when it comes, shine out like a celestial event.\nInnotes (8 pieces)and other early writings, Smith predicted the rise of a music that would draw from all the world’s traditions; neither composed nor improvised, it would becreatedthrough intellect and intuition. It’s a utopian ideal, and sadly one that has not come to pass. Nevertheless, his vision as a solo artist, bandleader, and member of avant-garde jazz collective the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians has been influential to generations of musicians, perhaps none more than the pianistVijay Iyer. When Iyer played in Smith’s Golden Quartet in the late 2000s, they formed a rapport that found full expression on the brilliant 2016 duo recordingA Cosmic Rhythm With Each Stroke, which proved Iyer to be Smith’s perfect complement—not filling in his silences, but accentuating them, imbuing them with tension and meaning.\nDefiant Lifeis the duo’s second album, recorded over two days of single takes in Lugano, Switzerland. To begin, Iyer and Smith discussed the state of the world and the histories of liberation that may point a way forward. The focus of those talks, and of the record, is the defiance needed to resist state-sponsored violence. “The defiant person knows completely and wholeheartedly what’s right and what’s wrong, and they cannot be persuaded to think any other kind of way,” Smith says in the liner notes. “And that defiance matches theiraction.” It’s an idea that has preoccupied Smith for decades, especially on his landmarkTen Freedom Summers, dedicated to key leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. During the recording of that monumental album, Iyer asked Smith what it means for instrumental music to express ideas regarding history or politics. “He said that it has to do with the sincerity of intent,” Iyer remembers. “That it matters in that way because those are the conditions under which it was created.”\nThe conditions that Iyer and Smith contemplate onDefiant Lifeare dire. The “ongoing sorrow and outrage over the past year’s cruelties,” in Iyer’s words, are the album’s impetus, and the genocide in Gaza haunts the album. The duo’s meditations on the darkness of the world are immediately apparent in the harrowing opener “Prelude: Survival.” Smith’s trumpet struggles and gasps; once it finds momentum, it only goes in circles. Iyer’s piano encroaches like storm clouds that menace but never break. The relative calm of the following track, “Sumud,” hints at a way out;sumudis an Arabic word meaning steadfastness, used to describe a Palestinian ideology of political resistance in the face of occupation. Smith’s trumpet, distant and uncertain, emerges from a background of glittering electronics. At times it disappears completely, but returns braver and bolder until the song climaxes with a graceful solo, clear as a blue summer’s day."

The Los Angeles-based singer, guitarist, and rapper is constantly on the lam in her yearning, restless songs, braving storms and wars in hermatte black truckas she guns for liberation. She rarely finds it. Even her more idyllic tracks, like the hopeful ballad “Glock Peaceful,” present sanctuary as elusive. “Then I opened up my eyes/Wasn't what I thought it would be,” she mourns after dreaming her block was free of cops and tension. Black joy, as Mereba depicts it, is always fugitive.\nShe finds refuge on her second solo album, a collection of hushed, incandescent soul and pop-folk songs full of reverence for the people and experiences that sustain her. The featureless album, her first with indie label Secretly Canadian, is more focused than her 2019 debut, a polished but scattershot set that bridged theFugees, Atlanta alt-rap, andBob Dylan. And it’s got more idiosyncracy than 2021’sAzebEP, an alt-R&B showcase that seemed to consciously tone down her folksy roots. The looser, guitar-driven arrangements she embraces here completely retool her songwriting, upping the immediacy of her wondrous music.\nMany of the songs center around simple declarations of devotion and affirmation. “You’re the original/Don’t let them counterfeit you,” Mereba sings sweetly on the opener, alluding toearly experiences in the label system. “If you ever needed love/I’ll be there for you,” she vows on “Ever Needed,” floating over jaunty krar strums that nod to her Ethiopian roots. The direct address compacts her storytelling and her phrasing, which often uses repetition to convey intimacy. “Then, then came you,” she coos repeatedly on “Out of the Blue,” referring to her young son. The song is more a mantra of gratitude than an origin story.\nThe record is full of quiet appreciation for the natural world and personal relationships. “Soft breeze brought my burning thing back to life,” Mereba murmurs on the title track, a spoken word piece with flecks of flute and acoustic guitar. She’s referring to the unexpectedly moving sight of a bird, and the relief of escaping grief,andthe thrill of rekindling her creativity. But Mereba delivers the line calmly, as if her world is always this emotionally rich. This newly understated approach to lyricism fits her airy voice, which feels like mist to the face: gentle, cool, soothing. Where she once depicted freedom in acts of passion and desperation—fleeing, fighting, resisting—she now threads it through the mundane. Tiny gestures and sensations become rapturous."

    "review_text": "In 1979, just as disco’s cultural omnipresence waned, a baseball stadium on Chicago’s South Side expressed its exhaustion with a ritual of destruction and fire. During a White Sox doubleheader, a local radio station ran a promo christened “Disco Demolition Night,” where audience members got in for a discount if they brought a disco record to be blown up between games. After the explosion, the predominantly white, rock-oriented crowd, hungry for more violent catharsis, rushed the field. The melee and the aftermath of the destruction got so out of hand that the second game scheduled for the night never occurred.\nAs silly and weirdly personal as the whole thing was—the event was largely the brainchild of a disc jockey who was fired from his rock radio station on Christmas Eve after they changed formats to disco—“Disco sucks” took hold across culture. Disco and by extension Black music’s primacy on the charts disappeared, leaving many Black musicians uncertain of how to move forward, how to make music that wouldn’t be reflexively hated by the audience that received it. There was no unscorched terrain in which it could grow and develop; it had to reinvent itself or else face extinction.\nSo they cleared everything away. Slowed time to a mid-tempo bounce. Used drum machines and synthetic handclaps to punctuate the beat. (“After they said [Chic] was a disco band and we sucked, that’s when we started to use a drum machine,” Nile Rogers said in a 2011 interview.) They absorbed the oscillating synthesizer innovations ofGiorgio MoroderandKraftwerkand used them to build a state-of-the-art R&B that to this day no one can agree on the name of. “Post-disco” is the most common designation, though it’s still known primarily as “boogie” in the UK. There’s also “electro-funk,” “funk and soul,” on and on. As with any imprecise genre, the different names are all intended to describe something specific but they blurrily apply to almost every R&B track released in the ’80s.\nThis new tradition steadily differentiated itself from disco. For one, disco music was crowded. It tried to contain everything, pack as much detail as possible into every second: strings, horns, synthesizers, ecstasy, devastation. You can hear how aggressively its surface glittered in order to barely disguise the pain beneath it, to keep people dancing even as they wept. Post-disco/boogie, by contrast, makes so much space available that, despite its lushness and generous detail, you could almost think of it as minimal, a canvas where the few elements painted on it make you think as much about the space they’re contained in as you do about the strokes themselves. It doesn’t usher you into an infinitely-repeating moment on the dance floor like disco. Its appeal is slower, subtler, not quite as desperate for your attention. It makes you nod your head, lean a little further back in your seat."

A year after the release ofImperial Bedroom, he insisted on quashing a reporter’s memories of what had been, in 1982, a critical triumph. “In each song there’s some fake psychedelia or a ’40s-style riff or things written with a strict format after the fashion of a standard ballad. I wanted to see what effect I could achieve,” heexplainedwhile promoting his follow-up record,Punch the Clock.Fair enough. But thenhe went further: “It just reached a point where I was getting so carried away trying to reflect the lyrics, the whole thing would end up sounding unbalanced.” So unlike other artists, hecanjudge the quality of his own material.\nWhile not a punk himself, Costello exploited punk’s energy into onslaughts against political and romantic hypocrisy. He did well in the UK and America from the start with the release of his 1977 solo debut,My Aim Is True,and the following year withThis Year’s Model, where he was joined by his backing band the Attractions. For a while, they could do anything, at home with tub-thumpers like “Pump It Up” and midtempo flourishes like “Accidents Will Happen.” Steve Nieve’s keyboards absorbed Booker T. & the M.G.’s andABBA; the rhythm section of bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas lent enough sinew to their leader’s metaphorical contortions to make them sound natural.\nCostello’s fluency with the burgeoning pop-rock canon made him the Boomer generation’s favorite quasi-punk.Linda Ronstadtcovered“Alison.”Lindsay Buckinghamregarded himas an influence when he pushedFleetwood Macinto the experiments ofTusk.

Reluctant to dwell in what “Beyond Belief” calls “a very fashionable hovel,” he bade farewell to longtime producerNick Loweand hiredBeatlesengineer Geoff Emerick, who, with the assistance of Jon Jacobs, givesImperial Bedrooma buttery sheen.

Cathcart grew up across the East River in Brooklyn and began recording music asthe Cradlein 2013. Across some 50 albums, the project has evolved from off-the-cuff experiments to increasingly intentional gems like 2018’sBag of Holding.\nDown on Themis Cathcart’s debut release under their own name and their first with “one band.” Cathcart, who has played in groups like Big Neck Police, Shimmer, and Climax Landers, found like-minded bandmates in bassist Miriam Elhajli, keyboardist Ellie Shannon, and drummer Bailey Wollowitz. Together, the ensemble builds intricate, transfixing melodies with a weighty undercurrent that’s reminiscent of the way a populous city can still feel profoundly lonely. And yet these are ecstatic songs, especially when the bandmates build progressively expressive harmonies, as they do to great effect on “Oh, Joy” and “Gender Neutral.” The mournful “Pale Grey Light” begins with Cathcart singing the titular phrase alone before their bandmates’ voices wrap them in an embrace for wistful lines like, “Goddamn, you showed me so many things/You showed me why I love life.”\nNew York City can sometimes feel like it takes more than it gives; a certain suspension of disbelief is required to continue paying rent. The 12 songs onDown on Themcapture the city’s extremes, weaving together struggle and cruelty, but also resilience and affirmation. The opening track “Your Reflection” is a brief glimpse at beauty witnessed while biking. It sounds like a gentle, early morning yawn, with a drumroll announcing Cathcart’s arrival much as a rolling gate opens a storefront.\nThe urban environment sustains tension: Weeds pop up between cracks in the pavement, rusty engines languish on the riverbed, and bird bones litter the streets. The easygoing “Invasive Species” weaves a local history of intrusion, from the displacement of the indigenous Lenape by the Europeans to the introduction of thespotted lanternfly. Time marches (or stomps) on in the city forever in a rush, but Cathcart and their bandmates have made a record that encourages close listening. “Cry on Command,” about a woman adrift in a toxic relationship, is rich with subtle textures. By all means, listen toDown on Themon a walk—but maybe also try leaving the headphones at home once in a while."

Win Butler is barely audible for the first half of lead single “Year of the Snake.” The album rollout has not inspired any credulousHollywood Reporterprofiles,interactive music videos, orfake websites. It lasted a month and has been accompanied by a near-total media blackout, save for a promotional tour of “intimate venues” and a frankly astonishingsixthappearance onSaturday Night Live. But the overall message has been clear: Arcade Fire would change their name if theyhadn’t tried that already.\nOf all the things Arcade Fire have learned fromU2, nothing has taken hold like the goal of “reapplying” to be the best band in the world. But while Bono only said that once, Arcade Fire have spent the past 15 years sinceThe Suburbsadjusting the cover letter and padding the résumé, desperate to figure out what the best band in the world is supposed to be. The irony and piety of 2017’sEverything Nowand 2022’sWEcancelled each other out, attached to works of great effort and little conviction that made Arcade Fire seem equally unpersuasive as satirists or saviors. That was only accelerated by the accusations ofsexual misconduct leveled against Win Butler in 2022. To whatever degree Arcade Fire were cancelled, the tours andSNL 50appearances were not. You could argue that bigger monsters are thriving in relative peace, or that Butler is being punished less for his actions than for how they conflict with his reputation. So it is in a culture that’s more forgiving of creeps than hypocrites.\nI might have avoided discussing this subject entirely if it weren’t the subtext and, sometimes, the text itself ofPink Elephant, casting a shadow far darker and longer than the still-imposing legacy ofFuneralorThe Suburbs.Arcade Fire spendPink Elephantcowering in that shadow, offering ambiguous sloganeering, non-apology apologies, and arena rock that gets moved to the 1,500-cap venue due to sluggish ticket sales. The opening three-minute, lunar-roving drone of “Open Your Heart or Die Trying” promises a spiritual reboot, but also promises the same cinematic grandeur of other Arcade Fire albums. They repeat this trick twice more, which ends up having the opposite effect, exposing a threadbare motif that sticksPink Elephanttogether like Scotch tape on a last-minute Christmas gift."

The British rapper-producer first left the Midlands in 2019, splitting their time between the U.S. and the UK before making LA their permanent home. It was a business decision: Their Auto-Tune-drenched, dance-rap melodrama was resonating far more in America than it had back home. The waythey put it, “There’s not a lot of money to get [in England]” for the music they’re making. The success of “rain,” a mutated R&B ballad that was both irresistible and inescapable last year, set the tone for the epistolary heartache of#gigi, their acclaimed LP, which married rage rap with pop, soul, and every regional subgenre you can move your hips to. But beneath the music’s undeniable danceability lies a fractured spirit.\nTheir new mini-album,#mia(short forManic in America), acts as a spiritual successor to their lovelorn breakout, using stadium rock and radio pop as the skeleton for full-blooded, 808-laden furor. Across 8 tracks in 23 minutes, skai is still calling out to a lover who can’t hear them, prostrating themselves in the name of reciprocity. Thedemoof “pop” they quietly released just after#gigifelt like a bare-bones plea for attention so specific that listening became voyeuristic.

The orchestral swells of the album version sound like heaven’s waiting room. Even in all of its desperation, it’s beautiful.\nRather than sifting through genres like on#gigi, the production on#miais firmly rooted in skai’s own meld of rap-rock electronica. On “feral,” twangy acoustic licks slide through claps, snares, and face-scrunching bass like butter, like a postmoderntakeonPluto X Baby Pluto. The languid fuzz simmering on the ground floor of “maria” tears a page fromDuster’sContemporary Movement,each strum wallowing in static. “You don’t feel the same.” is built around jaunty shards of electric guitar, but the track loses steam early when a cookie-cutter indie pop drum break barges in. This is#mia’s biggest pitfall: its inability to sit still. skaiwater’s music draws personality from its eclecticism and unpredictability, but clunky mash-ups and beat switches hold this record back. After “ur song” rumbles in with 808 thunderclouds and a scintillating synth lead, the stiff wall-of-sound guitar distortion jerks it off course."

Over a shuffling groove gleefully splitting the difference betweenDylan’s “Solid Rock” andthe Allmans’ “Midnight Rider,” Crockett vituperatively disclaims: “Everybody’s working in them cotton fields, just a little bit different than they used to feel.” It’s a jolting, anxious moment—the nervous invocation of cotton fields, the sort of thing that would turn up inRandy Newman’s subversive imagination. The song trucks along, untroubled. “I’m just a lonesome drifter on the only highway.” Still. With these gas prices?\nI would love to report that things improve for our narrator, but trouble for the troubadour is not a voluntary opt-out. The second track, “Game I Can’t Win,” is a Waylon-worthy pissed-off Nashville litany of false promises and bounced checks abetted byBurrito Brotherspedal steel. As a craftsman, Crockett has become admirably adroit. Plenty of songs onLonesome Driftertell multi-layered stories, but the longest one stretches barely beyond three-and-a-half minutes. The laudable economy of language resembles his fellow TexanTownes Van Zandt. So, for the most part, does the mood. The downward trajectory traced on “Under the Neon Lights” would not only disappoint Crockett’s own mother, butMerle Haggard’s too. The gloriously peak-bummer Kristofferson-style “This Crazy Life” makes absolutely no attempt to make sense of the singer’s crazy life, but does offer the irresistible olive branch: “Darling, you know I care for you/Though I’m not too good with love.” The “too” does a lot of work.\nHang around the bad part of town enough, and you might meet a guy like Crockett. “Never No More” resembles nothing so much as fellow tricksterTom Waits’ 1976 Crayola noirSmall Change. “One Trick Pony” grabs the title fromPaul Simon’s acerbic 1980 music satire either by osmosis ordeep cinema habits. Doesn’t strictly matter. “I’m bound to tell the truth the way that gamblers rarely do,” Crockett snarls. “They be tying up your noose and calling you friend.” With friends like that, who needs hangmen? Maybe it isn’t a coincidence that being a one trick pony might be a criticism leveled against him."

    "review_text": "Thus spoke Butt-Head: “Whoa. Girls. Whoa! These chicks rock.”\nBabes in Toyland’s “Bruise Violet” echoes across the MTV airwaves, as teenage cartoon delinquents Beavis and Butt-Head headbang and air guitar to the song’smusic video. “Is thatCindy Brady?” Beavis jokes, taking in frontwoman Kat Bjelland’s whipped platinum blonde hair, white babydoll dress, bright red lipstick, and piercing blue eyes. “Shut up, Beavis, these chicks are cool,” replies Butt-Head. The pair watches for a rare few moments of silence as footage of the Minneapolis three-piece thrashing their way through a set at CBGB alternates with scenes of Bjelland encountering a series of identically dressed doppelgängers. She strangles one of them, played by the renowned photographer Cindy Sherman. (Sherman’s photo of a creepy baby doll adorns the cover ofFontanelle, the album on which “Bruise Violet” appears.)\nAs Bjelland snarls the song’s refrain of “Liar! Liar! Liar!,” Beavis, mishearing, begins chanting, “Fire! Fire! Fire!” (An exasperated Butt-Head says, “Shut up, assmunch. She said ‘Liar.’”) Beavis continues his “Fire! Fire! Fire!” chant with every chorus, until Butt-Head intervenes: “Don’t make me kick your ass again, Beavis. We’re missing this video, and it doesn’t even suck.”\nIt was the summer of 1993, andBeavis and Butt-Headwas the most popular show on MTV. The animated hooligans were, arguably, the most influential rock critics in America. If an up-and-coming artist’s video made it through their gauntlet of juvenile insults unscathed, a career would be jump-started. Just askRob Zombie.\nIndeed, theBeavis and Butt-Headendorsement was the apex of Babes in Toyland’s short-lived commercial success.Fontanelle, their major label debut, had been released in August 1992. Despite reams of positive press, and the rising tide of next-Nirvanamania, the album had only sold around 50,000 copies by the start of 1993—a respectable number, but hardly enough to justify the amount of promotional resources Warner/Reprise had been spending on the band. But between theBeavisrave and a booking on the generation-defining Lollapalooza tour, things were looking up for Bjelland, drummer Lori Barbero, and bassist Maureen Herman. The label serviced a“Babes and Beavis and Butt-Head in Toyland” versionof “Bruise Violet” to radio and Herman appeared onthe Lollapalooza ’93 cover ofEntertainment Weekly. Sales began to climb;Fontanellewould go on to sell over 200,000 copies.\nIn October 1993, a five-year-old boy in Ohio burned down the mobile home his family lived in, killing his younger sister. His mother claimed thatBeavis and Butt-Head’s pyromaniac tendencies had inspired her son to play with matches. Almost immediately, MTV altered any episodes that referenced fire, including the one featuring “Bruise Violet.” The Babes video was replaced by a Butthole Surfers video for all subsequent re-airings. Even now, clips of theoriginal versioncan only be found in obscure corners of the obsessive fan internet."

    "review_text": "When British R&B trioFLOdropped their debut single “Cardboard Box,” a sugary sendoff to a cheating ex, they easily won over a pop audience desperate for an impeccable girl group that seemed to be having genuinefun. Singer-songwriters Stella Quaresma, Jorja Douglas, and Renée Downer met in 2019, after an Island A&R discovered them each from their Instagram cover songs. Despite being assembled in a somewhat old-fashioned way (through a male executive), they projected a distinct sense of identity from day one, having wisely spent three years perfecting their sound. “Cardboard Box” went viral in 2022, and two EPs full of punchyearwormsfollowed, featuring smooth, soaring runs reminiscent ofBrandyand harmonies that smush and melt like s’mores. FLO became the first group to win the BRIT’s Rising Star Award, performed at Coachella and Lollapalooza, and opened forKehlani. Their rise speaks to an ongoing appetite for American-style girl groups, even as uber-polished K-pop and J-pop acts dominate the nostalgia-driven scene.\nFifth Harmonywere the most recent U.S. girl group to resonate globally and did their best to refresh the surface-level girl power of the 2010s for a shrewd, selfie-loving generation. FLO is the next logical iteration of that ethos in a post-Lean Inera. Their empowerment pop feels intuitive and true to the way many twentysomethings move through the world with a sense that boundaries are real and that agency and respect are self-evident. But if a girl group’s main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, their debut album,Access All Areas, achieves it all with a decidedly R&B edge.\nOnAAA’s opening track, actor Cynthia Erivo drops in like a fairy godmother to introduce “a trio ready to receive the baton passed on by the likes ofDestiny’s Child, Sugababes,SWV, and countless other iconic baddies of the past.” True to that legacy, FLO’s debut delivers a confident vision of what a modern girl group can be: tender, headstrong, and unified, with a clear point of view about resisting the urge to be jaded by the industry, relationships, and themselves. The album rolls from airy bedroom R&B to trap-tinged self-affirmations. Tracks like “Nocturnal,” a quintessential bravado anthem, layer curling harmonies with staccato delivery in a deliberate nod to Destiny’s Child, who, as FLO member Douglas puts it, were “as close to perfection as a girl group has ever seen.” Like the UK’s Little Mix before them, FLO see imitation as both flattery and a starting point for their own unique alchemy."

    "review_text": "To the inhabitants of Menorca, a small Mediterranean island with a heavily agrarian identity, the parenòstic, or farmers’ almanac, dispenses ancient wisdom with a sprig of oracular foresight. Its pages offer a compendium of long-range weather forecasts, phases of the moon, guidance on when to plant and when to prune—when, even, to slaughter pigs, chop firewood, or cut hair. Its history reaches back to at least the 17th century, but in modern times, the dog-eared text has been updated to encompass saints’ days, hunting seasons, recipes, horoscopes, poems, and advertisements for local businesses. The wordparenòstic—a portmanteau that fusesparenostre(“our father,” i.e. He who art in Heaven) withpronòstic, a Catalan word for “prognosis” or “prediction”—appears to be used principally in the Balearic islands. That insularity surely appealed to the Menorcan singer, songwriter, and scholarAnna Ferrer, who borrowed the term for an album in defense of the island’s folkloric traditions.\nParenòsticbegan as a solo performance co-produced with the heterodox flamenco musician Niño de Elche: a minimalist set piece featuring little more than Ferrer playing keyboard or guitarrón beneath stark illumination, with all emphasis on her repertoire and her stunning voice. The album maintains the show’s unadorned feel and intimate mood. Ferrer’s songs are heavily rooted in local tradition: Some come from religious festivals, others were passed down by generations of farmers working in their fields. Some can be heard in everyday island life even today, while others she discovered while digging through dusty archives.\nMost are sung in Menorquí, the local language, kin to Catalan, though a few are in Spanish. (One song, “Son tus ojos dos puñales,” interpolates a stanza from “La Llorona,” a song made famous by the iconic Mexican singer Chavela Vargas, with a local folk melody, illustrating the cross-pollination to which even the most deeply rooted traditions are susceptible.) But even listeners with no grounding in Balearic idioms or culture may be captivated by the eerie beauty of these intensely focused performances. Ferrer needs nothing more than her subtle, smoky voice and a single instrument—sometimes not even that; the liturgical “Heu” is sung a cappella, fleshed out with multi-tracking and cathedral reverb—to hold her audience rapt.\nThe album begins by cracking open a time capsule: An eerie melody sung by what sounds like an old woman strains through vinyl distortion, as though arriving from a great distance. In a way, it has: The song, “Deixem lo dol” (which means something like “let us not mourn”) is a relic of local Holy Week traditions; the archival recording was made years ago by a woman in Saint Augustine, Florida, where a contingent of Menorcans arrived in the late 1700s. Immediately it becomes clear that Ferrer wants to bring this music forward in time: As she braids her own voice with the spooky crackle of the recording, she is accompanied by a plucky synth arpeggio. The result is partAlan Lomax, partWendy Carlos."

    "review_text": "The title “Distant Storms at Sea,” fromMark Barrott’s 2016 albumSketches From an Island 2, felt like a subtle joke. Inclement weather could never breach the paradise Barrott conjured in his music, an almost-too-perfect island fantasy alive with avian and simian chatter, apparently inspired by his everyday life on Ibiza. (He’s now living in mainland Spain, off the grid somewhere in the mountains between Barcelona and Valencia.) A shift began with 2022’sJōhatsu,rooted in a score he wrote for a documentary about Japan’s missing persons, and more mournful than anything he’d made before. It was easy to assume the film’s heavy subject required the composer to shift gears slightly, that this was a one-off and we’d soon be back in Balearicland. Yet Barrott’s new albumEverything Changes, Nothing Endsis his most tempestuous release, filled with urgent kettledrums and churning strings, as if those distant storms have made sudden landfall.\nThis time, Barrott’s music reflects a personal tragedy—the loss of his longtime partner, Sara, who passed last year. It’s as if Barrott made a pact with himself that he wasn’t going to write about the sun and the sea this time around, pushing the hand drums and wah-wah guitars aside to lean into grand orchestral pomp and ambient shimmer. The music has a blocky, oblong quality: The choir on “Pandora” and “January 25th” barks out clipped, staccato phrases, and the strings play either in rigid eighth notes or sylphlike glissandos.Everything Changeshas less to do with Barrott’s previous work than with one of the unheralded masterpieces of Balearic music: Valencian composerPep Llopis’s 1987 albumPoiemusia la Nau dels Argonautes,which implied that a place with as much human and natural history as the Mediterranean coast must be a little bit haunted.\nEverything Changesruns 42 minutes, about average for Barrott, but it feels shorter because of how much more happens on the first side. Opener “Pandora” pivots from almost martial bluster to sublime Rhodes ruminations. The “Butterfly in a Jar” suite follows, commencing with string swells worthy of some Homeric epithet like “rosy-fingered,” then taking a left turn into the kind of slow-burning digital jazzBiosphereexplored onDropsonde.The tracks on the second side, meanwhile, are pure pools of ambient, with the strings rarely rising above a flutter. Because the titles (“It’s Just Like Falling Asleep,” “The Light Is Still There”) concern themselves explicitly with mourning and death, one can easily readEverything Changesas a chronological travelogue of Barrott’s relationship with his late partner—the earlier tracks burning with the fierceness of the life they shared, the later tracks conjuring sleepless nights and fading apparitions."

    "review_text": "On June 26, 1972, 11 inflatable domes were opened to the public in Pamplona, Spain. They looked like a Martian outpost or, from the air, like amassive fried egg. This alien structure was the setting for theEncuentros, an arts festival hosting the vanguard of modern music:John Cage, David Tudor,Luc Ferrari, andSteve Reichall participated. It was a dangerous undertaking for Spanish artists in the waning days of Franco’s dictatorship. “It must be said that at that time, all contemporary musicians were suspect—that is to say, we were considered conspirators. The secret police came to our concerts,” the electronic composer Eduardo Polonio explained in 2009. At Pamplona, “Suddenly things were being exhibited that—due to their capacity for astonishment, their will for change, their strangeness—were at the very least going to alarm the forces of the regime.” The sponsorship of the powerful Huarte family ensured that the event would go on despite the Franco government’s denunciations. However, the more proximate danger came from ETA, the Basque separatist terrorist organization, who planted explosives at the site. For Polonio, the political turmoil was so much background noise; he was only ecstatic to find himself among like-minded artists. “What I remember is that it was like a state of levitation,” he said. “Like we were really floating.”\nThe Encuentros de Pamplona was emblematic of the early years of Polonio’s long and influential career, when he was creating groundbreaking music against the backdrop of Francoism’s decline and Spain’s transition into democracy. This crucial era is documented onObra Electroacústica 1969-1981, a compilation that documents his growth into one of Spain’s foremost electronic artists. Finding music education under Franco to be utterly conservative in the late ’60s, he was forced to seek out the avant-garde on trips to Darmstadt and Ghent. He eventually found a home at Madrid’s ALEA, the first electronic music laboratory in Spain, also sponsored by the Huartes. There, he produced a run of remarkable works and became a member of Alea Música Electrónica Libre, the first group to perform live electronic music in the country. When ETA kidnapped Felipe Huarte in the wake of the Pamplona festival, the Huartes ceased their cultural patronage and Polonio was set adrift, working odd jobs throughout Europe and North Africa. But in 1975, the year of Franco’s death, Polonio returned to music via Barcelona’s Phonos Electronic Music Laboratory, once again free to invent and reinvent Spanish electronic music.\nPolonio’s oeuvre grew more complex as his career progressed from the late ’60s into the early ’80s, gradually incorporating influences from musique concrète, minimalism, Arabic music, and flamenco. “Oficio,” the earliest piece here, is dead simple on its surface: two low-frequency generators are run through an electric guitar amp and modulated in real time, with no edits or overdubs. It’s a setup that a child could play—Polonio would later create sound workshops for children, too—but in his hands it’s like a magic box that summons cascading waves of electronic glissandos, some of the purest noise this side ofMetal Machine Music. “Rabelaisiennes,” also from 1969, takes Polonio’s penchant for simplicity in an entirely different direction. He insisted that this piece for prepared acoustic guitar be classified as electroacoustic because of its use of objects under the strings to mimic effects like filters and ring modulators. Small daubs of sound populate an otherwise blank canvas in a slow meditation that anticipates guitar deconstructionists like Taku Sugimoto."

    "review_text": "Disco has always been a refuge. For people of color, queer people, trans people, night owls, glamorous psychonauts, assorted hedonists, and those just looking to dance their cares away, disco’s euphoric siren call has proven irresistible throughout the years. Its dancefloors foster a sense of community essential to the survival of people on the margins; they turn momentary relief from oppression from an escapist fantasy into tangible reality. In disco, differences are celebrated, pleasure is an art form, and optimism is mandatory.\nDisco was also a haven for Matthew Urango. Under the pseudonymCola Boyy, the multi-instrumentalist released a string of bedroom-funk pop records, carving out a niche where he could fuse the grandeur of late-’70s/early-’80s club music with the emotional gooeyness and homespun charm of a kid plucking a bass guitar in a room in Oxnard, California, the seaside town where he grew up. Cola Boyy was also born with spina bifida, kyphosis, and scoliosis—he was known to refer to himself as a “disabled disco innovator”—and was as serious about his music as he was about his activism, both as a disabled person and as an Afro-Latino with an immigrant background. “None of my songs are necessarily political,” Cola Boyy said in a 2018interview; “I mean they are, in the sense that I wrote them, but the way I look at the world is through a lens of my own experiences.” In a world that often refuses to see disabled people as all the things disco represents—carefree, exuberant, sexy—Cola Boyy’s perspective isn’t just novel, it’s necessary.\nCola Boyy’s second album, a collection of tightly woven, endlessly endearing, and seismically groovy songs calledQuit to Play Chess, is also his last. On March 17, 2024, he passed away, tragically and suddenly, at his home in Oxnard, at the age of 34. Incredibly, that was also the day he delivered the final version of the album to his label Record Makers, making it not just a posthumous release but a living snapshot of the last era of his life. It’s an extremely complex record, emotionally—it goes way beyond the cliché of “teardrops on the dancefloor” to land on a truth so bright it stings to look directly into its glare. The album’s pain is equal to its joy, its dark corners only visible because disco lights are dancing across the walls. It’s like hanging a mirror ball in a pillow fort: This party will be fleeting by nature, but in the meantime, let’s tear this shit down.\nQuit to Play Chess’ lead single, a chest-swelling barn-burner called “Babylon,” begins with a cracker of a line: “Baby, tell me is there Hennessy in heaven/If not I’m gonna nosedive straight to hell.” Notions of Cola Boyy’s own mortality are woven throughout the song, and the album in general, but the liquid wah-wah guitars and space-age synths are about as far from melancholy as humanly possible. Given the circumstances, it might seem like the song is about searching for everlasting bliss in the afterlife, but as Cola Boyy sings its refrain—“I’m on fire”—you realize that he’s referring to heaven on earth, in the arms of a woman, “true romance” in “leather boots.” He approaches heavy topics with admirable nonchalance, facing them head on rather than hiding behind saccharine platitudes."

    "review_text": "Not so long ago, it would have been a bizarre novelty ifStephen Malkmushad tried his hand at a sonata, or ifInterpolhad staged an evening-length multimedia work at Lincoln Center. But concert music needed to loosen up once the old divisions became almost absurd to maintain, and indie bands—well, as their industry collapsed, they needed money, and some had reached a level of professionalism that easily upscaled. Now we don’t think twice aboutBryce Dessner,Annie Clark,Julia Holter, orHamilton Leithausersplitting time between hang-out and sit-down shows. Why shouldn’t David Longstreth?\nDirty Projectorsseem ideally suited to this kind of thing. They distinguished themselves with complex time signatures, mosaic vocal techniques, nonlinear structures, and ambiguous tonality—sweetly coated, sour-centered. Their magpie psych-pop has often snagged bits of classical in its darting path. YetSong of the Earth, Longstreth’s first major piece for a large ensemble, shows how different writing an hour of concert music is from writing an hour of songs. It’s a challenging, arduous, fitfully rewarding work that favors density and creativity at the expense of clarity and continuity—long music for short attention spans.\nSong of the Earthwas commissioned by the Berlin-based chamber orchestras t a r g a z e, conducted by André de Ridder. Though named after Mahler’s song cycleDas Lied Von Der Erde, the album evokes late-’60s auteurs likeBrian Wilson,Van Dyke Parks, andScott Walker, their juiced-up harmonies and huge, shivery arrangements swirled into the nervy minimalist brew of contemporary chamber music. Longstreth has said he wrote the first draft in six “manic” weeks, disoriented by the new pandemic and new fatherhood, and that really is the best word. With 24 tracks, often subdivided into little cubicles, it’s a long hour that keeps starting over. Dirty Projectors’ Felicia Douglass, Maia Friedman, and Olga Bell contribute a lot, and guests likePhil ElverumandSteve Lacyare in there somewhere. It’s probably best in concert,for which it was designed. But at home, it’s nearly monotonous in its restless variety.\nThough the overall picture is blurry, the individual parts can sound good, with a few exceptions: “Gimme Bread” is an early primer on the album’s unique mess and excess. As Longstreth croons under his range, there’s aPet Sounds-y part, then a harp freakout with people chanting, then a riffy part, all before the menacingPharoahe Monch-style horns burst in, taking the climactic insight about bread a little too seriously. In “Uninhabitable Earth, Paragraph One,” Longstreth sings an extract from a climate journalist’s book verbatim, which seems like a cool thing to try before instantly seeing why it doesn’t work well at all, let alone with a little gospel-rap prelude."

    "review_text": "There’s a conundrum in the state of drill music. As the sub-genre inches closer to becoming a two-decade-old project and achieves significant textural advancements to its sound from continuously replicating itself, the incentive for artists to distinguish themselves as storytellers actually becomes less crucial. That isn’t to say that rappers who do find ways to differentiate themselves—like Philly’s Skrilla or the late Chicago rapper BloodHound Lil Jeff—aren’t rewarded.\nBut in the DMV, where insulation has been historically celebrated in Black homegrown forms of music, the need to stand out in their Free Car Music subset of drill doesn’t feel particularly important right now. Whether you listen to AC640, Skino, Jodyboof, or a host of others with vocal cords that still sound fairly adolescent, you could very well predict how a song will go with relative ease. You’ll hear so many variations of “Hop in that car,” “Hit my vic,” “Go spin on they men” every few bars that it starts to feel as if there’s a limited word bank for them to pick from. This has created a scene so homogenous that any semblance of deviation can, if done right, get eyes on you immediately. Naturally, much of that legwork is reserved for the scene’s producers who’ve been chipping away at this sound for the past decade.\nAn artist currently ascending from this world is DC’s SlimeGetEm who, after a timely rebrand, began accumulating a healthy amount of traction from his home region and various corners of the internet. Last March he dropped “Mashallah I Cooked Him” a song which, in just over two minutes, features the rapper tirelessly using his squawk of a voice to detail how he wreaks havoc in ways you’ve likely heard before. But it’s what happens underneath those assertions that grabs you by the collar. Some signature Free Car bells, underwater filters, mini explosions, 2000sGucci Manead-libs, and a synth that evokes visions of walking down a dark tunnel during a state of emergency all come together to establish a sound so psychotic that you’re called to let it wash over you. What SlimeGetEm says adds texture, but the most captivating element here is that it feels like he’s rhythmically screaming through the apocalypse. The man responsible for these hellish contributions isTrapMoneyBiggie, a Rotterdam-raised producer of Cape Verdean heritage who has never even been to D.C., Maryland, or Virginia. But, largely due to the success of “Mashallah I Cooked Him,” he is one of the scene’s most sought-after beatmakers. As for SlimeGetEm, the song offered an opportunity at a second wind inside a scene that’s teeming with reputable competition. A few years ago, as SlimeHundo, SlimeGetEm made waves in the DMV for being a comedic troll rapper who’ddrop diss songsaimed toward people he got into it with on social media. It helped pass the time during COVID lockdowns, but wasn’t enough to secure him a spot. Now, with TrapMoneyBiggie handling beats on much of Slime’s work over the past year, he’s become one of the more visible underground DMV rappers.GetEm, his new 12-track project, will likely further his rise."

    "review_text": "Lauren Duffusis an astronaut lost in inner space. In the video for “N.U.M.T.E.”, the artist moonwalks through South London in a RalphLaurenspacesuit, navigating packed dancefloors and streets as cold, empty, and unforgiving as the far side of the moon. Apart from a quick smoke break, she’s hermetically and emotionally sealed off from the city around her, adrift in her own orbit. It’s difficult to tell whether the song’s desperation is being muffled by her helmet or if we’re picking up on a distress signal from a galaxy far away. Through bleary synths and gasping vocals, you can just barely make out the message: “I need you more than ever and Ifellawaiiiii…” before the voice staggers and recedes into mournful static.\nThe British producer excels at channeling hard-to-name feelings into vaporous, borderless tracks. Her songs are composed of pleas without answers, calls without responses, and locked-in emotional states whose tension crests but never resolves. The psychodrama is front and center, but in Duffus’ hands it’s never stifling. She’s enamored of music that paints in washed-out colors on the biggest canvas possible: witch house’s booming, foul air, doom metal’s slow-motion majesty, and the all-consuming dread of UK and Chicago drill. Duffus draws upon their atmosphere to craft weightless, post-genre collages blanketed with tissue-thin layers of voice. Her latest EP,Can’s Gone Warm,is her most fully realized and strangely accessible collection of music to date, giving exciting new shape to fleeting emotions.\nLike any number of young British artists working in theDean Bluntschool of deadpan art-pop, Duffus is a cryptic presence who offers little set-up or backstory for her music. But even if her voice billows and blares like a hauntedBurialsample, you can still make out the contours of a pop song within her work. Our most reliable guidepost is her vocals, which she layers and abstracts until the shape of the song, rather than its lyrics, becomes the main driver of its meaning. On tracks like “Super” and “Liar,” Duffus pitches her voice somewhere betweenJanet JacksonandGrouper, articulating her longing in sultry R&B hooks that are sped up and washed out until they resemble pure glossolalia. The interplay between the EP’s misty surface and its effervescent melodies reminded me ofKelela’sAquaphoria, and suggests that Duffus could just as easily be a straight-up pop performer as anElizabeth Fraser-style experimental vocalist.\nThe power of her songs’ blurred outline varies in its intensity. Duffus leaves her greatest mark on tracks where the production seems to shape her voice in real time. Her vocals on “N.U.M.T.E.” streak and smear against ghostly synths and the song’s fast-paced drum’n’bass rush, as though her words were being lost in translation in real time. “Liar” offers some modest stage-setting as Duffus chants “5 a.m. in Deptford” before her airy singing is subsumed by the murder-hornet whir of a synthetic drum break. She doesn’t need to fill in the specifics of what happened; the music is shattering enough on its own. Although it’s just a stone’s throw away geographically, “Lewisham” is a notable step down. The track is pretty but meandering, so feather-light that it's insubstantial. Over some grounding harp plucks, Duffus churns over the phrase “ooh this is something” with varying degrees of loving clarity and mushy surrender. By the song’s end, it’s hard not to feel like the “something” in question was a whole lot of nothing."

    "review_text": "In a December 2023 essay, songwriterEmily Sprague wroteabout her fascination with “thin places”: times or places “where the barrier between our world and all that lies beyond it becomes porous,” often as a result of a near-death experience, a loss, or a creative flow state. “I think of magic as being always around us in these forms of the natural world and the mysterious things that occur within it,” she wrote. “We can’t harness it, but we can take part, witness, and be in awe.” OnJellywish,the fifth album from her indie-folk bandFlorist, Sprague expresses this sense of wonder through the worldly-yet-otherworldly avatar of the jellyfish. One of the most ancient life forms on Earth—predating the dinosaurs, they’ve been in existence for more than 500 million years—jellyfish are mysterious things indeed. They have no brains, yet they learn and have memories; their intricate nervous systems soak up sensory information through the entirety of their porous bodies. OnJellywish, the presence of this near-alien creature floats through Sprague's lyrics as a constant reminder to always soak in the world around us with a sense of wide-eyed awe.\nThe “thin place” between two worlds is also represented by the punning of the record’s title: not just a jellyfish, but a jellywish, something even more intangible and ineffable. It’s an apt name for a record that’s grounded in the earthly, existentialist folk that characterized Florist’s previous releases, but also has a playful, almost hallucinogenic quality. In its most intimate moments, the album recalls Sprague’s starkly vulnerable 2019 solo outing,Emily Alone,but also weaves into its fabric a light touch of the ambient, electronic textures that filled the band’s 2022self-titled record.\nThe small miracles of everyday life populate these songs. Sprague sees domestic life, familial love, and community through a sun-streaked lens on “Sparkle Song” and “Our Hearts in a Room.” But her lyrics mostly return to subjects she has revisited so many times that, onJellywish,she also reflects on her weariness of talking about them: grief, death, and mortality. Here, though, even these topics are part of the record’s life-affirming warmth. This duality characterizes “This Was a Gift,” a bittersweet song about mourning and heartbreak as necessary seasons of love. The song begins deceptively simply, but gradually expands its horizons outwards. Though death is sprinkled throughout Sprague's chanting chorus, she delivers it like a rallying cry, buoyed by a jubilant flourish of meandering electric guitar melodies."

    "review_text": "Onduendita’s tender debut, 2018’sdirect line to My Creator, the Queens singer-songwriter explored spirituality, grief, and the importance of lineage in whorls of painterly detail. Her work casts soul music through an experimental prism, combining shuffling beats and sparse guitar and bass around a voice with the resonant grace of a cello. Six years later, duendita returns withthe mind is a miracle, a reflective and spellbinding EP recorded largely in Berlin and released this past summer. Here, she expands on her immersive, heartfelt music, crafting an expressive meshwork of ambient, soul, and pop music against languid, piano-laced backdrops.\nduendita hasn’t been absent since her first LP; in March, she debutedSound River, an audiovisual project focused on New York’s East River. To make it, she toted around a handheld recorder, using it to catch errant neighborhood sounds or dunking it into the river itself to see what reverberations she could gather. The excavatory use of field recordings extends tothe mind is a miracle, where from-life snippets add depth and grain to meditations on mental health and self-confidence. Piano and the sound of chirping birds and insects captured during a trip to California’s Redwood National Park open the EP, giving way to the gently strummed guitar of “multi.” “There were times where I was hurting but I try not show it,” she admits, before a curlicuing melody pointedly turns her mood around: “Ooh, believe it, bitch/I’m beaming and it overflows.” Voice memos of friends, family, and herself punctuate the EP with a sense of community and collaboration that has long been an essential element of her creative output.\nduendita pairs that emerging sense of self-confidence with pillow-soft music. “Yeah, I don’t mind no waiting/My Lord, He made me patient,” she sings over warm guitar on the brief, lovely “planetary,” fleshing out the prayer-minded work ondirect line to My Creator. Her inclination toward soothing sounds is a way to shed inhibitions and find truth in bare-bones simplicity, whether through lyrics or compositions. Chicago musician Erik Hunter (aka Matthew Skillz) contributes a mellow, rippling bassline on “alright!”; New York-based bassoonist Joy Guidry’s hypnotic, lilting performance on “feel” moves like an ebbing tide behind duendita’s impassioned pleas. “Silence is violence, baby boy, don’t you hide it,” she sings tranquilly, “Still your smile gets me so excited.”\nthe mind is a miracletempers its more introspective moments with some levity. The standout “soupie” drapes duendita’s voice over a muffled, rolling club beat that sounds like it’s echoing from an adjacent room; her vocal riffing extends and contracts to reflect lyrics about a conflicted, flustered state of mind, producing a deliriously lively approach. On closer “born with power,” she surfaces a well of inner strength by looping her voice into a vortex over piano and warbling noise, creating a meditation for anyone who needs a self-affirming pick-me-up: “You were born with power,” she intones in a silken voice, “You don’t have to buy it.”the mind is a miracle’s soft-focus mantras prove that for duendita, nothing could be more true."

    "review_text": "When Angel Olsen runs out of space in a notebook, she doesn’t immediately buy a fresh pad; instead, she crams her latest thoughts next to her old grocery lists in the middle. It feels like less pressure to begin in media res—somewhere between the milk and the onions—than to start with a “hello, it’s me again.”\nFor Olsen, another album is a fresh notepad; an EP a transitional phase tucked in the margins. Since the release of her debut album in 2012, Olsen has found various ways to ease the stakes between major releases, popping her head back in without having to reintroduce herself entirely. In 2017, that took the form ofPhases, a 12-track catalog of discarded songs and covers; in 2021,Aisles, a wilfully frivolous bunch of ’80s covers. With her latest album, 2022’sBig Time, in the rearview (alongside its companion EP, 2023’sForever Means), we now have another Olsen interregnum:Cosmic Waves Volume 1, her debut compilation series. It features two halves: Side A, a selection of original songs from a range of under-the-radar artists, as curated by Olsen; Side B, Olsen’s own take on a song from each of the featured artists.\nCosmic Wavesis a bolder experiment than any of her previous interstitial releases, though it’s consistent with Olsen’s career-long fascination with the act of interpretation. In Olsen’s music, love is a constant act of projection and analysis—so when the love fades, so too does the ability to read the other. “Now it’s impossible to conceive/I don’t know who can see you,” she sang onBig Time’s opening song.Cosmic Wavesis, too, an act of love, reinterpreting the very act of reinterpretation. Since the project is organized around promoting lesser-known artists, its cover songs become a medium not of association but of loving introduction.\nHowever, with Olsen’s name hanging over the compilation, it’s a struggle to hear each artist on their own terms, and the act of comparison inevitably creeps in. It’s almost irresistible not to hear each of the songs on Side A filtered through an Olsen-like rubric: In Poppy Jean Crawford, there’s Olsen’s barreling cadence and winsome vocalizations; in Coffin Prick, the prismatic light show of Olsen’s synthier moments. These two bombastic tracks are sharply followed by three slow, twilit ballads, and listening to them together feels like eating a chocolate cookie where all the chunks are lumped together on one side. But if any of the tracks demand to stand out on its own, it’s the heavy-lidded romance of Sarah Grace White’s “Ride,” a song of spartan yet swoonsome melodies that cast a contrast against the busy arrangements of the other songs. Among the artists, White comes closest to Olsen’s singularity, though that’s exactly what Olsen tries to conceal in the second half."

    "review_text": "With about a minute left inBLACK’!ANTIQUE,Pink Siifuunfurls the moral of his dense parable through the voice of the Dungeon Family’s Big Rube. “When we were created, there was no mold/Just original style, with original soul,” Rube says, before launching into a measured diatribe about the ancestral sources and resounding strength of Black creativity. It’s the brand of stunning closing tableau Siifu has become adept at crafting—after lulling you into a daze with his meandering, creaky vocals against idyllic guitar and the sound of running water, he snaps the attention back. In a flash, Rube’s piercing baritone becomes the conduit for Siifu’s declaration: “My people are original and divinely unique,” he says, taking a prophetic tone for the album’s last breath. “And our value will keep rising, like some Black antiques.”\nBLACK’!ANTIQUEis the fourth studio album from Siifu, and his first solo release since 2021’sGumbo. Across the lush, laid-back melodies on his 2023 collaborationsLeather Blvd.(withAhwlee) andIt’s Too Quiet..’!!(withTurich Benjy) and the reverse-engineered neo-soul, funk, and punk on the stellarGumboand 2020’sNegro, the Alabama-born artist has morphed his rapping to marry his creative impulses with influences like the Dungeon Family,Sun Ra, andSly and the Family Stone.BLACK’!ANTIQUEcontinues to fulfill the prophecy of remaining “divinely unique”: This is Siifu at his boldest, oscillating from abrasive to soothing on a whim. Though some ideas are a bit rough around the edges, his vision is remarkably clear as he unwinds over the splendor of a vast production landscape.\nFollowing in the community-built vein ofGumbo,BLACK’!ANTIQUEfeels akin to a rambunctious family affair with frequent Siifu collaborators including artists Benjy,Liv.e, and V.C.R, and producersRoper WilliamsandHiTech. The 33-year-old rapper’s chameleonic ability to contort his croons and mutters to the surrounding atmosphere helps his guests feel comfortable—sometimes to the detriment of the record’s balance. There’s an unevenness to the album’s early stretch: Siifu’s furious shrieks are nearly overpowered by blaring,Inception-esque drones on the Williams-produced opener (“Black’!Antique”), and the combination of noise rap and ambient textures on “Alive and Direct’!” never seems to get off the ground. These aren’t stylistic departures for Siifu, but when held up against the groove he settles into throughout the rest ofBLACK’!ANTIQUE, the extra entropy registers as out of place."

    "review_text": "Lily HiattbeginsForever, her sixth album, singing about discovering a “Hidden Day” tucked away somewhere between Thursday and Friday—a secret to be shared among confidants, performed exultantly. It’s a fitting keynote forForever, an album that wears its intimacy as a point of pride yet doesn’tsoundlike we expect intimacy to sound; Hiatt appears right at home settling into its joyous racket.\nThe tender tenor ofForeveris a far cry from the bruised heart beating throughTrinity Lane, the 2017 album that served as the Nashville-based singer-songwriter's critical breakthrough; it’s also a shift fromWalking Proof, the adventurous, colorful album Hiatt released in the early days of the pandemic, in 2020.Forevermarks a distinct change in musical direction for Hiatt, taking her away from her Americana origins and into shambling alternative rock indebted to the glory days of grunge.\nThe catalyst for the shift is Coley Hinson, a Nashville-based musician she married in 2022. Operating on the fringes of the Music City since the second half of the 2010s, Hinson amassed a handful of notable credits—including co-writing a tune on Brent Cobb’s fine 2018 albumProvidence Canyon—before he played on a pair of tracks onLately, the record Hiatt rushed out in a daze in 2021. The pair hit it off so well that they formed a duo calledDomestic Bliss, with a name that walked the line separating sincerity and snark. Domestic Bliss cut a record at home, releasing it without fanfare in 2023, but a new album from Hiatt didn’t come as easily. She spent that year putting out singles that were seemingly part of a new album, but she ultimately switched gears, ditching that project in favor of a new collection of songs, all featuring Hinson at the mixing board as well as playing the lion’s share of the instruments.\nDespite Hinson’s heavy presence,Foreveris a decidedly different listening experience than the unvarnishedDomestic Bliss.Foreveris very much a complete studio set, a successor to the densely detailedWalking Proofbut effectively its opposite. Hiatt paintedWalking Proofon a broad canvas, layering each song with vivid colors, giving it a vibrancy that felt playful even when it drifted into melancholy.Foreveris barbed and direct; its blemishes are intentional. Those rough edges—distorted vocals, clanging acoustic guitars, thick waves of fuzz, and wailing organs—are all given a distinctly ’90s alt-rock bent by Paul Q. Kolderie, who previously mixedRadiohead’sThe Bendsand engineered the earliestPixiesrecords. “Man” is the one song on the record that could conceivably be categorized as country, but the sunbleached chords, ghostly echoes, and sighing steel guitar also play like an excavated tune fromMazzy Star."

    "review_text": "ConsiderIf You Asked for a Pictureas the second chapter in an ongoing novel chronicling the trials and tribulations of life in your 20s. On Sabrina Teitelbaum’s second album as Blondshell, which arrives two years after her eponymous debut, Teitelbaum is still haunted by the past and stumbling into the kinds of bad decisions that fueledBlondshell.Her head may be clouded by contradictions, yet here, she conveys these conflicted feelings in an increasingly confident, self-assured musical language.\nThat sense of impending clarity derives from an expanded soundscape of swirling, shape-shifting textures created by Teitelbaum and Yves Rothman, who reprises his role as producer fromBlondshell. Opening track “Thumbtack” feels like the album in microcosm. What starts simple gets complicated quickly, as finger-picked acoustic guitars feint at folk before the song gets softer and richer, echoing the mellow breeze of yacht rock while retaining a nervy emotional center.\nTeitelbaum remains rooted in the sound and sensibility of 1990s alt-rock, marrying the skeletal strums of lo-fi with billows of dream-pop harmonies and squalls of oversaturated guitars. Where her peers can occasionally seem mired in the moors of revivalism, Blondshell deploys these sounds in a painterly fashion, letting the fading echoes of her voice intertwine with decaying guitar distortion and occasionally puncturing her sighing melodies with shards of noise.\nThroughoutIf You Asked for a Picture,Teitelbaum’s affectless voice cuts through the enveloping fog of introspection. After spending a song perched between a murmur and a sigh, she’ll unexpectedly deliver a lyrical barb, its bluntness emphasized by her lack of a vibrato. Again and again, she’s sorting out the mess of romance, resigning herself to staying in a partnership for practical concerns (“I’ll stick with you, ’cause I like sleeping well, she sings on “He Wants Me”). On “Man,” wondering if “a lot of wiggle room” and drugs are reason enough to be in a relationship, she describes herself as “a kid wanting to cancel.” But for most ofIf You Asked for a Picture,she’s plagued by the immaturity of others. Often, she pictures herself in a maternal role, bearing the responsibility of parenting immature boyfriends. She flatters the subject of “Two Times” by singing “You’d be a good dad/You carried me to the bed,” a description that hits harder after hearing how the accidental lover of “T&A” “turned right from a man into a boy.”\nSome of the album’s parental imagery comes from a heavier place; Teitelbaum’s mother died in 2018, and several songs appear to address their relationship. Over a crawling tempo that gains in intensity as guitar overdubs pile up, Teitelbaum flashes through adolescent memories on “Event of a Fire,” realizing if “part of me never left her in 2012/Part of me is still getting all of my haircuts for someone else.” The memories turn prickly on “What’s Fair,” when she deliberately sours her empathy with pointed accusations, all delivered as a piece of urgent fuzz-pop. All this rumination builds to “23’s A Baby,” where she asks a direct, spiky question: “23’s a baby,” goes the chorus, “Why’d you have a baby?”\nThe painful truths of “23’s A Baby” never feel anguished thanks to a persistent pop pulse. It’s a trick Teitelbaum and Rothman pull off repeatedly throughoutIf You Asked for a Picture: The songs may arise from turmoil, but the production is enveloping and inviting, suggesting there’s a path out of the darkness. The album’s last track, “Model Rockets,” with its dreamy girl-group sway, cements this impression, pivoting on the line “The problem is I don’t know what I want anymore.” The lyrics are born of confusion while the music is vivid and assured—a paradox that exemplifies Teitelbaum’s emergence from her 20s bearing evident scars along with a stronger sense of self.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

She gotname-droppedby Drake. Her latest albumleakedat the beginning of the year.Stans are shaking their fists at the skydeclaring they were here first, and will wait patiently until the rest of the worldfinallycatches up. But even with her 12.9 billion streams (and counting), extensive world tours, and co-signs from pop’snewguard, the Canadian performer’s onstage starpower consistently seems misaligned with her unprovocative take on pop. On her third album,So Close to What, the pop star amps up the 2000s pop-inspired tracks, dials up the sex, and sprinkles in the ballads, as a small treat. And while the result is more enjoyable than its predecessors, its nostalgic rush still can’t make up for its lack of originality.\nMcRae’s second album,THINK LATER, traded bedroom-pop ditties for club-ready bangers—a deliberate about-face that aimed to position the dancer and singer as the nextBritney Spears(see hersweaty music videosandred carpet references). If that album felt transitional, overloaded with the teenage sentiments of her debut album,So Close to Whatrepresents her most mature record yet. Even her contemplations of returning to toxic exes, for the most part, feel more considered than the naive callouts of the past. “Revolving door” drives forward with a pulsing bass and finds McRae returning to an ex-lover time and time again. “I confess, I’m not that versatile,” she sings, knowing that even though the wound finally healed, she’ll willingly be maimed again. “Say I’m good, but I might be in denial.”\nThe pursuit of perfection usually leads to sterilized artistry—just ask any hardworking dancer who’s been given the cliché advice to loosen up and get messy—andSo Close to Whatfinds McRae mostly embracing life’s rough edges instead of skirting around them (it’s hard to imagineTHINK LATER-era Tate listing all the places she’d like to get freaky with her new beau as she does here, on theYing Yang Twinshomage “Sports car”).So Close to Whatis chock full of danceable bops, including the standout “2 hands,” whose tinny, pitched-up refrain sounds likeCalvin Harris’ “Slide”—another reminder, however catchy, of the album’s dependency on callbacks. The breakup track “bloodonmyhands,” meanwhile, is competent, but featured artistFlo Millioutshines McRae, plus the Miami-bass embellishments might have fared better if it wasn’t following inthefootstepsofseveralotherswho embraced the rollicking 808s more impressively last year."

    "review_text": "In one of the more damning passages of Liz Pelly’s new Spotify exposé,Mood Machine, Darius Van Arman—co-founder and co-owner of Secretly Group, an indie conglomerate that’s home toPhoebe Bridgers,Mitski, andBon Iver—says that, upon the advent of streaming in the United States, labels like his realized they had to sign acts that warranted “repeat listens in coffee shops.” Spare a thought, then, for Alaina Moore and Patrick Riley, the seafaring married couple who make up the long-running indie-pop duoTennis: They were making tunes that sounded great in Anthropologie long before the likes ofMaya HawkeandBoygeniustrendified Starbucks CD music for bisexual teens. That their placeless, timeless blend of Laurel Canyon folk, 1980s pop, and 2010s dream-pop revival isn’t more popular strikes partly as a matter of exceptionally bad timing: Tennis’ gauzy 2011 debutCape Dorycouldn’t hold its own against more personality-driven compatriots likeBest CoastandKurt Vile; by the time they graduated to more distinctive songs like 2020’s “Need Your Love,” a bulbous, sugary retro-pop track with an alarming beat switch, all anyone wanted was the hazy, soporific pop they used to play.\nTennis’ new record,Face Down in the Garden, is also their last: After completing the album, they said in a statement, “It became clear that we had said everything we wanted to say and achieved everything we wanted to achieve with our band … We are ready to pursue other creative projects and to make space in our lives for new things.” It contains one of the duo’s best songs, the intoxicating “12 Blown Tires,” and is, as ever, sumptuously produced, with every gentle drum fill and twinkly synth hit rendered in admirable hi-fi. It’s exceedingly pleasant and, often, little more—a great record to justput on, as a matter of lifestyle.\nBut it’s not an album that’s likely to hit particularly deeply, in part due to the way Tennis’ lyrics overshoot universality: Often, Moore is expressing feelings general enough to adorn a greeting card, or relaying the kind of story that’s too unremarkable to tell a friend. Although “At the Apartment” opens with unadorned, slightly dull specificity (“We lay on the floor/Dissecting every sound on some old 45”), the song’s second half contorts into something more abstract as Moore’s words take on surreal urgency: “Takes more to be your man/I’m the one who understands/Sleep tight, blue dunes/Blue ruin, salt dunes.” The same cannot be said of sequel “At the Wedding,” which devotes its four verses to a blow-by-blow account of what sounds like a mostly anodyne occasion. “At the wedding you refused to dance/Because the music was all wrong/And you added ‘Neither of us dances anyway,’” sings Moore. It is the kind of rich, shiny vintage R&B song that will sound perfect during a wedding montage in a Prime Original. And the lyrics are plain enough that you won’t take your eyes off Sydney Sweeney."

    "review_text": "For 50 years, a copy ofTed Lucas’ sole, self-titled album felt like a secret treasure—a coveted charm you might pull out only when the closest friends dropped by, whispering “Have you heardthis?” before putting the needle on a record that shouldn’t actually exist. In the early ’70s, Lucas was a frustrated Detroit guitar whiz in his early 30s. Two of his rock bands had already been dropped by Warner Bros., and his once-steady Motown session work with the likes ofthe Temptationsandthe Supremeswas vanishing as the Motor City institution wheeled away for Los Angeles.\nSo Lucas multi-tracked six songs alone in his attic and dispatched the demos to Warner, only to be rejected again. He eventually added an instrumental second side, paid to press it twice on his half-real OM imprint, and distributed the thing himself in irritated fits and starts from home.The OM Record, as it came to be known, slowly emerged as a jewel accidentally tossed in the private-press folk dustbin. Even reissues—particularly a2010 co-releasebyWillam Tyler’s retired Sebastian Speaks label—could command price tags above $100. Cited as an influence byClairoandDevendra Banhartand covered byMountain ManandJulianna Barwick, it is, after all, a magical little thing, as softly stunning as any other bit of idyllic psychedelia committed to tape amid the long afterglow of the lysergic ’60s. You had to keep your copy ofThe OM Albuma secret; the songs are instantly addictive, and there just weren’t enough to go around.\nAfter a half-dozen small editions during the last half-century, Lucas’ only LP is, at last, permanently available thanks to Third Man Records. Motivated in part by their mutual Detroit origins, co-owner Ben Blackwell isleading the first true archival excavation of Lucas, moving beyond these nine mostly perfect songs to explore the full scope of his chameleonic music—and his self-sabotage within the music industry. The project starts, as it should, with a generously expanded reissue ofThe OM Album. Four digital-only bonus tracks instantly prove this wasn’t some fluke, while the concise but expansive liner notes by Detroit music historian Mike Dutkewych finally explore the backstory of someone so mysterious and magnetic that he has been rumored—at various points, and with no real corroboration—to be the inspiration for “Mr. Tambourine Man.” This is the full treatment these songs have so long deserved."

    "review_text": "Three albums deep and nearly a decade into their career,Mamalarkyembody a tactful self-assurance—a quality that’s universally sought after but hard to achieve, and a classic example of the idiomeasier said than done. By flexing technical muscles that are underutilized in indie rock on theirself-titled debutand coaxing out the artful charm of prog on 2022’sPocket Fantasy, the Atlanta-based quartet parsed out a unique sound and learned how to own it. Their latest album,Hex Key, revels in all the benefits that confidence affords: enviable nonchalance when singing, adventurous hooks that shouldn’t worm their way in as easily as they do, and art-rock song structures that dare you to guess what comes next. You can trace a path from the band’s beginning to this point, but that fact doesn’t make this latest step any less impressive; even longtime fans might be tempted to do a double take in admiration, as if to ask, “Wait, this is the same band from back then?”\nThroughoutHex Key, Mamalarky move cleanly through complex motions and form rubbery angles with their instruments. It’s a little like watching an avant-garde dance troupe perform to unlikely deep cuts: Noor Khan’s queasy bass slides in “Broken Bones” would makeDeerhoofproud, Michael Hunter’s cool-headed keys in “Blush” blossom like the jazzy psych-pop ofCrumb, and singer Livvy Bennett’s flirty coos over funk-lite R&B in “Nothing Lasts Forever” recallAva Luna. Across the album, Mamalarky escalate their trippy art-rock until it sounds like they’re an eight-piece band pushing how weird their jam improvisations can get without their Epitaph rep noticing. Take the album’s strongest single, “#1 Best of All Time,” whose two minutes of BPM-goading delirium come courtesy of drummer Dylan Hill having tracked his part in a frenzy while recovering from a bout of poison ivy. Whether it’s the disparate vocal techniques that interrupt steady stomping in “MF” or the pots-and-pans metallic percussion that dots Bennett’s cheery guitar solo in “Blow Up,” Mamalarky have never sounded more at home with their musical jitters.\n“The worst thing you can say about a Mamalarky song is ‘This sounds like another song of yours,’” Khan recently said. While the general sentiment there is true—Mamalarky has managed to expand their sound without chasing a musical makeover—the album’s lowest two points, “The Quiet” and “Hex Key,” fall short of that guiding principle. The former song leaves Bennett alone, in a bog of güiro croaks and flute flutters, to ponder the squandering of her childlike inquisitiveness while a recurring blast of synth drowns her out. With its repetitiveness and the longest runtime on the album, “The Quiet” recalls Mamalarky’s early experiments in directionless interludes. It’s given no favors when followed by “Hex Key,” a blown-out dream sequence of a song whose chorus retreads the sonic scope of its verses. The song’s percussive textures and production flicks are a sign of Mamalarky’s idiosyncratic vision, but where does it head?"

    "review_text": "Grief saturates Dawn Richard & Spencer Zahn’sQuiet in a World Full of Noise, as integral to the record’s beauty as ghosts are to a gothic novel’s tone. The air between Richard’s soulful, diaristic lyrics and Zahn’s austere piano is charged, pulled taut as wire. The silence is louder than the noise; we feel absence keenly, an imprint left behind by loss.\nThis austerity is a departure for the duo, whose 2022Pigmentsincorporated saxophones, autotune, and looping synths for large, arcing compositions. Here, Richard and Zahn have moved from the cosmos into a snowglobe, downsizing on instrumentation and vocal bravado. WherePigmentswas soaring,Quietis, well, quiet—impressions delivered like elegies. Richard and Zahn are willing to play with space here, where notes are often bookended by reverberant silences and the moments of suspension feel just as meaningful as Richard’s throaty confessionals.\nThere’s a clear through-line between these disconcertingly intimate songs and the personal grief that informed them. Richard was reared in New Orleans, a city that bares its own violent past to anybody willing to book a walking tour. Phantoms are woven into the region’s appeal. She made her big break on MTV’sMaking the Band, a reality TV vehicle that manufactured the band Danity Kane in 2005. During this time,she alleges she was assaulted and abused by Diddy; in the interceding years, between releasing six solo albums as an indie R&B artist, her musician father was diagnosed with cancer and her cousin Cisco was fatally shot seven times. Multi-instrumentalist and composer Zahn wrote the melodies on the heels of a break-up, using an unconventionally tuned piano in an upstate New York studio.\nThese tragedies are laid bare, discussed with minimal allusion, onQuiet. “Traditions,” a wistful and doting ode to family, fuses Richards’ tightly-observed love for her kin with Zahn’s meandering piano. The record is at its most haunting when we feel closest to these memories, like voyeurs into the past: the way Richards’ mother leaves a brick in front of the door, a voodoo practice; the way her brother wears a certain pair of shoes to lend the Saints luck.\nOn the moving “Life in Numbers,” resonant piano chords give way to Richard’s near-whisper. Is it a prayer or a possession? It feels like we’re right there with her, grasping at reality. “Two times is the amount of texts I sent to Cisco before he got gunned down,” she rasps into the microphone at the end of the song, before Zahn’s fingers dance over the keys, cycling through the same few plaintive notes."

    "review_text": "Robert Palmerspent his long career perched between rock stardom and cult fame. He became one of the key artists of MTV’s golden age thanks to “Addicted to Love,” a crunching rocker married to a video that mitigated exploitation with irony. The sight of Palmer performing in front of an army of anonymous supermodels became one of the iconic rock images of the 1980s, pushing “Addicted to Love” to the top of theBillboardcharts in 1986, 12 years after he launched his solo career withSneakin’ Sally Through the Alley.\nClues, Palmer’s sixth record, appeared in 1980, halfway between that 1974 debut andRiptide, the parent album to “Addicted to Love.” Fittingly,Cluessounds as if it’s caught between two worlds, attempting to shed the skin of the album-oriented 1970s as it evolves into the electro futurism of the 1980s—a metamorphosis vividly captured on the album’s two singles, “Looking for Clues” and “Johnny and Mary.” Palmer wasn’t the only rocker dabbling in new-wave fashion in 1980. The underground started to bubble up into the mainstream that year, withAlice Cooper’sFlush the Fashion,Linda Ronstadt’sMad Love, andPaul McCartney’sMcCartney IIall incorporating the sequenced synths of new wave.\nWhen he releasedCluesin September 1980, Palmer was nowhere close to being in the same league as those rock stars. He was a journeyman, one whose first big break arrived via Vinegar Joe, a hippy hangover he co-fronted alongside Elkie Brooks. Too slick for the underground, too shaggy for the mainstream, Vinegar Joe released three records in the early 1970s that demonstrated Palmer’s gritty rasp and appealing sense of control, not to mention his superior sense of taste, at least compared with the rest of the outfit. These characteristics caught the eye of Chris Blackwell, the head of Island Records, who signed Palmer to a solo contract that allowed the British singer to surround himself with expert American musicians. OnSneakin’ Sally Through the Alley, he countedthe MetersandLittle Feat’s Lowell George among his supporting musicians.\nPalmer kept pace with ease; his unflappable delivery suggested he was holding some energy in reserve. He began to thread reggae into funk onPressure Drop, a record where he shared the album cover with a naked woman, the first in a trilogy depicting Palmer as a mischievous playboy: He’s winning a game of strip poker onSome People Can Do What They Like, grinning over a pair of discarded bikinis onDouble Fun. A satiny veneer enveloped his records, yet he kept his arm’s distance from pop; he remained a resolutely album-oriented artist, barely scraping theBillboardcharts as he doggedly toured America."

On one hand, BAMBII scorches through the sounds of her Jamaican roots via turbo-charged riddims and booming bars delivered in barrel-chested patois; with the other, she tempers the fire with frosty electronica and mechanical garage, casting a delicious chill over the dancehall heat.\nWhen the firstINFINITY CLUBEP appeared in 2023, it had been almost 10 years since BAMBII first made her name as a DJ in Toronto’s Black queer scene. As host of the influential party JERK, she developed a performance style that reflects the defiance and self-possession required to create your own cultural spaces. (Consider a recentBoiler Room set, where she bluntly chastised the crowd for having their phones out before dropping a 2-step remix of Darude’s “Sandstorm.”) This sense of curatorial control comes through onINFINITY CLUB II, which boasts more songs, more features, and a wider breadth of production styles than its predecessor. IfINFINITY CLUBwas the perfect introduction to BAMBII’s digitally mutated take on Caribbean dance music,INFINITY CLUB IIdives deeper into that cross-section of identity by layering even more genres and themes into its shuddering bashment and pulse-raising jungle.\nBalancing all of these ideas is “Mirror,” a collaboration withJessy LanzaandYaeji. All three are accomplished DJs and producers; BAMBII and Yaeji in particular are kindred artists, both using Western club music as a medium to explore cultural heritage and immigrant experience. Inside “Mirror,” borders dissolve: BAMBII’s feathery vocals swell between the notes of a sparse, R&B-shaded bassline as Lanza’s crystalline harmonies are chased by a skittish jungle drumbeat. By the time Yaeji’s signature deadpan raps filter through, it’s as if we’ve teleported through a Y2K Darkchild production and emerged in the middle eight of a K-pop song from 2015. But BAMBII’s production never feels chaotic; on the contrary, every track seems purpose-built to keep you under her spell.\nIn moments when BAMBII leans harder into dancehall,INFINITY CLUB IItransmutes toward a danker sensuality. Jamaican American rapper BEAM scores features on two of the most immediately danceable tracks: On “NSYNC,” his staccato delivery hopscotches through the EP’s filthiest, borderline industrial bashment beat. “Spit” adds the talents of Lady Lykez, the North London rapper who previously contributed her cocksure flow to “Wicked Gyal,” a highlight from the firstINFINITY CLUB. Here, she and BEAM roleplay as possibly the horniest couple ever, trading lines like, “Dash out ya meat/My body mek mon run call police” and “Me raw that dog like Anubis dog/Osiris god with a Horus rod.” Anyone who’s ever spent the night sweating to a Jamaican soundsystem knows that good dancehall is about shameless hedonism, and BAMBII transposes this sex-positive liberation onto her own tightly woven sound without missing a cavernous, quivering beat."

    "review_text": "It’s almost comforting how immediately the newPissgraveplunges you back into the shit. Without a moment to spare, the Philly death-metal extremists’ first album in six years commences with what sounds like vocal cords being torn from someone’s throat. The jackhammering blast beats don’t let up for a second. Their guitar tremolos still buzz like they’re sawing a hole in your speakers. And, of course, the album cover features artwork of a real rotting corpse, maggots and all. Yes, this is the Pissgrave we all know and cherish.\nIt’s been 10 years since the band debuted withSuicide Euphoria, and you’d still be hard pressed to find a metal outfit with a more vicious sound. In a genre that’s generally averse to taking itself too seriously, Pissgrave are committed to remaining mysterious and legitimately frightening—whether in disturbing artwork that harkens to a time when metal bands were routinely and tastelessly off-putting, or in their almost complete lack of interviews, decipherable lyrics, or anything else to humanize their unholy noise. “We are under no obligation to make death metal friendly or palatable,” frontman Tim Mellon explained in a rare zine interview from 2020, in between taking shots atIncantationsoundalikes, the gentrification of Philadelphia, and “hipster black metal” bands. The phrase he casually uses to describe his own group’s music is probably the most helpful compass toward their frame of mind: “hateful death metal.”\nIf Pissgrave want to scare off hipsters, then working with Profound Lore—a label renowned for bridging genres—might not be helping their cause, but maybe they’re just trying to hit the enemy where it’ll hurt. Either way, there’s little danger of them ever becoming a major crossover act, andMalignant Worthlessness(rumored to be their final album) actually muddies some of the clarity they established on 2019’sPosthumous Humiliation. Where that release brought a (relatively) cleaner sound than their debut, occasionally even slowing down to let actual melodies shine through,Malignant Worthlessnesssplits the difference, carving out slightly more intricate riffs without ever letting up on the beatdown. They still mostly operate on one frequency, but the more you let yourself sink into their morass, the more hypnotizing it becomes.\nThe biggest switch-ups come via Mellon’s vocals; his guttural enunciations are slightly more audible here, and his pitch-shifted growls yield a more varied array of sounds. He gnashes and snarls his way through the opening grooves of “In Heretic Blood Christened” before dropping his voice to a low chant on “Three Degrees of Darkness,” like some infernal beast baring its teeth before a kill. The queasiest effect hits at the end of “Heaping Pile of Electrified Gore,” when he distorts his vocals into a spoken-word passage that sounds as if he were cursing us in some ancient tongue—real druid shit. These psychedelic flourishes draw attention to longtime collaborator Arthur Rizk’s masterful production, and to how differently he handles Pissgrave’s sound compared to other projects. Where he might emphasize the more cavernous qualities of groups likeBlood IncantationandPower Trip, with Pissgrave he takes an approach closer to his work withPrimitive Man, drilling directly into the band’s flayed feedback and mulching it with their endlessly rolling snares into a cyclone of filth."

    "review_text": "James Hetfield sing-grunts the word “bitch” six times on “Ain’t My Bitch,” the comically distasteful opening track offMetallica’s 1996 albumLoad, taking great pains to never pronounce it the same way twice. In the first chorus it’s “biiiiii-tchah” plus a kind of “beeyotch…ohhhhh,” while in the second chorus he goes “betch-yah,” then “beyaaaaatch,” followed by “biiiiiiiihiiiiiiitch-no-it-ain’t-mine,” and finally, a single, gleeful, guttural “OOH!” followed by a word that sounds like a combination of “BINCH!” and “BELCH!” on the outro. It’s this kind of psychotic attention to completely unnecessary detail that helped Metallica establish themselves as the progenitors of a particularly brutal brand of thrash throughout the 1980s, as well as spend the mid-’90s and early 2000s just as adeptly dismantling almost every iota of that goodwill. Metallica were iconoclasts, waging perpetual war against eardrums, the music industry, their peers, and even their own members. And withLoad, there’s more than a little truth to the notion that the band had found a new target for ire: its own fans. It’s the slow album, the sellout move, the hard rock record whose packaging was littered with deliberate provocations. And now, there is more of it than ever.\n“All preconceived and preexisting ideas of who we are and what we’ve done are at a point right now where we’re standing at a massive potential point of rebirth,” declared Lars Ulrich in an interview with the official Metallica fan club magazine leading up to the original album, which appears in the 128-page book accompanying the box set edition ofLoad’s recent reissue. The fact that Ulrich’s statement is a little incoherent is a perfect encapsulation of how, by the mid-’90s, Metallica were certainly going forsomething, but no one, including them, was exactly sure what that something was. They’d scrapped their original, unfathomably cool logo for something blandly modern, the spiky typographical flourishes on the M and A of the original sanded off in favor of a sans serif containing only a hint of the danger. They got haircuts, trendy ones, which for reasons too convoluted to get into, infuriated their fanbase.\nThe drastic visual rebrand inadvertently primed Metallica’s audience for the sound ofLoaditself, which cast off even the barest vestiges of their thrash past and was instead chock-full of unsettlingly lumbering riffs, boogie-woogie-oogie solos, talk box fart sounds, spoken word drivel, a heavy Skynyrd influence, and even a straight-up country song.Load’s cover image, a pre-existing work by the conceptual artist Andres Serrano, has been read as a provocative response to society’s newfound paranoia about the body and its functions amid the AIDS crisis, or perhaps an exercise in intermingling symbols of life and death, creativity and decay. It is also, textually, a picture of blood intermingling with jizz. Such is the duality of Metallica, a band who even and perhaps especially at their best walked the fine line between totalizing brilliance and knuckle-dragging brutality."

    "review_text": "A lot of your favorite rappers have catchphrases. People tend to call them “ad-libs,” which sounds cooler, but they’re really just catchphrases—even if they aren’t words at all. There was a time when all it took was a grunt fromRick Rossto let you know a track was gettingshut down. FromBoldy James’ “Where we at wit’ it?” toMyaap’s “On my daddyyy,” announcing your presence is a requisite in every corner of hip-hop. A distinctive catchphrase makes you stand out; a refined arsenal of them can make you the center of attention. EnterChy Cartier, an emergent Tottenham-bred firecracker whose London twang compounds her phonetic explosions. The 20-year-old rapper’s debut mixtape,NO BRING INS, doesn’t start until her signature chirplet rings out: “Bap! Bap! Bap! Bap!” Since her ascent in the UK last year, Chy has become synonymous with this phrase; she drops it inradio interviewsandfreestyleswhile her fans spam it in the comments. When she kicks off a track with a fluttering giggle instead, it’s the kind that spells impending doom. Every now and then, she’ll melodically roll her tongue as if she’s spraying bullets from the back of her throat. All the while her syncopated flows and roughneck punchlines impose themselves over quivering bass. “Let’s be frank likeLampard,” she spits on “Not the One.” Alright, Chy, the floor is yours.\nCartier’s onomatopoeic blitz culminates on single “Yo,” a breakout moment and a microcosm of her menacing appeal. She cartwheels through the gritty, minimal, speaker-knocking backdrop from Enfield producer BKay, a regular collaborator. The way she introduces herself is so saditty it almost hurt my feelings: “Ask ‘What’s new?’/Like you know that I been in the stu’/Foot in the cookin’/I don’t like ugly, never dependent/Come good lookin’.” It sets off a potent hook that bleeds right into her verses in a fist-clenched stream-of-consciousness. What sets Cartier apart is she almost never lands where you’ll expect her to in a rhyme scheme. In this case, it makes for unexpected finesse. Other times it feels hamfisted. On “Problem,” she lets her bars linger past measures at uncomfortable lengths, seemingly forcing lines that might’ve looked better on paper. Over one of several laid-back,Meek Milltype beats, she sounds pedestrian for the sake of being palatable.NO BRING INSsplits two ways: About half of its 12 tracks use brute force to roll heads, while the other half tries to ease the tension with vibey restraint. Chy Cartier is at her best when she’s stepping over people, not when she’s trying to stand eye-level with them."

    "review_text": "Kiss the Ringwas a triumphant moment forRome Streetz, the culmination of a long-simmering underground career filled with razor-edged street raps and furrowed-brow beats. It was Rome’sGriseldadebut, extending a hot streak for the prestige label that kicked into high gear withWestside Gunn’s 2020 magnum opus,Pray for Paris. Gunn tapped the perfect team of gritty-but-trippy producers for Rome’s nasal, piston-firing delivery, and Rome seemed to dip his pen in acid. There’s an argument thatKiss the Ringwas the apotheosis of the Griselda sound, the last moment before the dam broke and flooded DSPs with half-hearted boom-bap revival drums and vaguely hard-nosed coke raps. Rome has struggled to fully separate himself from the glut; subsequent records, like 2023’sNoise Kandy 5andHatton Garden Holdup, his 2024 linkup with founding Griselda producerDaringer, feel like walking in circles—Rome’s in constant motion, but headed nowhere.Trainspotting, his new collaboration withConductor Williams, is a solid, mostly successful attempt at a reset. Conductor produced nearly half ofKiss the Ring, and the album builds upon their excellent chemistry. It’s an enjoyable and sometimes entrancing listen, even if it falls a little short of their previous magic.\nRome’s main strength is his capacity to make acrobatic rapping sound easy. He’s a masterful technician in perpetual motion, churning out stanzas that fill every space of a beat with mesmeric precision. He can take somewhat pedestrian rhyme schemes and break them into syllabic math problems, creating tension that leads to startling payoffs. The lines, “I’ve been shittin’ on every cheap rinky-dink rendition/Do somethin’ different, you’ll probably get a listen/I’m in Louis linen, lit in Lisbon, livin’,” on the second verse of “Connie’s Revenge,” don’t exactly push the bounds of slant rhyme, but he moves around the downbeat like a deft boxer, landing the end of each phrase when you least expect it. It’s thrilling to hear him nail a particularly daring bar structure and never break a sweat.\nThe problem is that Rome’s writing doesn’t always match up to his technical prowess. He seems more interested in maintaining a mythos than in pushing his pen to new heights—the punchlines aren’t really zingers, and the boasts of microphone or sexual prowess come off a bit first-thought best-thought. His stories feel authentic to him, but distant to the listener; it’s the feeling you get when you stare at a word long enough to forget its meaning. Conductor’s trippy, off-kilter style suits his sneering delivery well, but it’s disappointing to hear a rapper with such commanding presence issue boilerplate rhymes like, “You sold your soul to the pied piper/Shit I touch turn to gold, I’m a prime-time rhyme writer,” over production thisweird. Overall, these songs sound great, but you could control-x any of Rome’s verses, paste them on any beat from the Griselda extended universe, and not really notice."

    "review_text": "How does one arrive at nihilism? It can’t be the origin point of a belief system. Surely there was light along the way. Was it hope dashed, snubbed out like a cigarette on the sole of a boot, that caused the black veil of ennui to lower? Or could it be that societal abnegation is a direct cause of listening to too muchFlipper, the Bay Area punk band who in the 1980s took potshots at mindless happiness with their nonstop morose couplets? “Ever wish the human race didn’t exist,” begins one of the rhetorical questions posed in their song “Ever,” “and then realize you’re one too?” Quite frankly no, I hadn’t, until you brought it up.\n“Ever” is the first song on Flipper’s 1982 debut,Album – Generic Flipper, and it’s a doozy. In three short minutes, vocalist Bruce Loose (formerly Lose; he added the extra “o” later in an attempt to be less of a bummer) spews a series of scenarios that make it clear he wouldn’t be too much fun on a first date. “Ever live a life that’s real, full of zest, but no appeal?” “Ever play the fool and find out that you’re worse?” “Ever look at a flower and hate it?” It feels like Anne Sexton wrote a children’s book.\nFlipper’s music is correspondingly off-putting. The band members were ostensibly punks but avowed fans of theGrateful Dead. The blend of those jammy instincts with punk attitude is surreal and often weirdly dazzling. On “Ever,” the downbeats and handclaps are like something out of a Frankie Avalon movie, but it’s not beach music, unless a typhoon looms. Ted Falconi, on guitar, sounds like a drunk trying to play aBuddy Hollysong. Drummer Steve DePace keeps time, barely. Loose has a depraved yelp whose disgust subsides only at the song’s end. “Well, have you?” he says. “I have,” he answers, with a touch of shame. And the echoed rejoinder: “So what.”\nThe song makes a solid case that the world’s gone rotten, but instead of offering resistance or condolence, it gives you a wedgie. Still, it’s that final phrase that gets you:So what… After all the buildup, after all the flowers and ugliness, nothing really matters anyway. Those two flippant words get to the core question at heart ofAlbum – Generic Flipper: Is it better to have hope and be disappointed or not to care in the first place?\nFlipper formed in San Francisco in 1979, a time when punk was bleeding into hardcore, and Jimmy Carter was losing reelection. The American underground had anger on its mind; indifference was uncommon. The puckishness of punk, a snotty new genre that had grown out of rock a decade earlier, was beginning to evolve into hardcore, a steelier genre, with more fury and less fun. Originators on both coasts ripped through songs in two or three minutes, vocalists yelling invectives, while the drums marched along, unsettled.Minor Threat, Washington, D.C. hardcore originators, had vicious and obstinate songs like “Screaming at a Wall,” “I Don’t Wanna Hear It,” and “Seeing Red.” Los Angeles’Black Flaghad “Nervous Breakdown,” “Life of Pain,” “Thirsty and Miserable,” and “Depression.” It was impassioned music, and listening could be cathartic, if not exactly joyful."

In America, wet n wild is the absolute cheapest makeup you can get at the drugstore—the sticky glitter you buy for costume parties, or because you are 14. “Wet & Wild” is also one of the deliriously cheap thrills on British pop singerRose Gray’s debut,Louder, Please, a record with infernally catchy dance-pop hooks and the nutritional value of cotton candy.\nLouder, Pleaseis billed as Gray’s debut, assuming you overlook 2021’sDancing, Drinking, Talking, Thinking, a seven-track independent release that proposed her as a sort of jazzed-upAdeleyou could play on your way to the party without fear of getting irretrievably deep in your feelings.

First-wave iconUffieeven picks up a writing credit on the charminglyAqua-tic “Just Two.” Enter the party clichés: nose drugs, Bianca Jagger on a white horse, a YOLO anthem that goes, “We won’t save any lives tonight/What a time to be alive.” Imagine: What ifSabrina Carpenterwere 30 percent more techno? What if OGQTwalked out of cyro-storage and into a Chill Dance Hits playlist? What ifKylie Minoguebut, you know,the Dare?

    "review_text": "In the late 1980s, fashion label Polo Ralph Lauren became intertwined with hip-hop culture thanks to the Lo Lifes, a Brooklyn crew founded by rappers Thirstin Howl III and Rack-Lo that dressed head-to-toe in Polo gear. Their brand loyalty spread far beyond its Crown Heights and Brownsville origins: “Everything Polo to the floor though, even at the grocery store though,” Atlanta’sKiller Mikerapped on 2012’s “Butane (Champion’s Anthem).” Each piece in Polo’s 1992 Stadium collection, with its tastefully cluttered, logo-heavy aesthetic—including the “1992” race bib iconography—became a coveted trouvaille for aficionados, the celebration of that year’s Olympic Games morphing into a broader symbol of triumph over competition.\nIt’s that legacy of sportsmanship and style that Toronto rapper-producer duoRaz FrescoandFuturewavereference in the title of their new album,Stadium Lo Champions. They’re avowed Polo heads—“Lauren Story” is a new Lo Life anthem—and as on their first album,2020’sGorgeous Polo Sportsmen, their cartoon likenesses appear dipped in the brand’s designs. The two artists have spent over a decade honing distinct, workmanlike identities: Raz is the streetwise and spiritual Five Percenter, a loop-digging auteur who composed a nine-album series affirming comic book antihero Magneto’s calls for violent revolution. Futurewave is one of the architects of the barren, sinister thump that’s taken hold in pockets of the Rust Belt and greater Northeast’s underground, with a knack forinspiringmenacingperformancesfrom his collaborators. OnStadium Lo Champions, the duo embraces and updates the ’90s East Coast template for a rewarding take on a classic sound.\nThe best songs onGorgeous Polo Sportsmen, like “Gorgeous Gortex” and “God Is Better,” hinted at a lush boom-bap traditionalism that tipped its cap without succumbing to nostalgia. Mostly, though, its tentative jams felt like the product of two talented artists orbiting an idea but never touching down. They subsequently released a substantial body of work separately; Raz’s bleakly psychedelicMarvelous Right Wrist(2022) felt like a turning point, a showcase for his production prowess, pointed storytelling, and curatorial sensibility. Futurewave likewise hit a real stride starting in 2022, dropping great collaborations withBoldy James,Eto, and Estee Nack. They reunite forStadium Lo Championswith a sharper, more practiced approach and their chemistry blooms, perhaps because the two were able to get together at Raz’s personal studio, the Bakery, rather than trading files over email.\nStadium Lo Championsis full of effervescent, minimalist grooves and largely devoid of the bloodshot tension that’s characterized much of Raz and Futurewave’s previous work. Raz’s hyperactive delivery still seems beamed in from mid-’90s New York, and Futurewave’s drums still crack like cautious steps on thin ice, but there’s more air around each element. On “Olympic Flame,” a flute shimmies through the openings between Raz’s words, distant percussion gently pushing forward. The syncopated jazz sample on “Honestly” nudges against a rigid drum pattern, creating a sense of swing deepened by Raz’s circular flow. There are lots of mentions of microphones and namechecks ofJay-ZandNotorious B.I.G.songs, but Raz can make this golden-era bravado sound exhilarating, like when his rhymes tumble over themselves on “Mind Light”: “It manifest what my mind show when my eyes closed/Not for a like on a phone, a title, or throne/It’s hip-hop that brought the light to my soul/The prototype, ice form on every mic that he hold.”\nDespite its clear, spacious mixing,Stadium Lo Championsfeels outside time, as if it really were recorded in the ’90s and only recently unearthed from some moldy basement in Park Hill, Staten Island. It hits all the right marks: esoteric slang terms delivered with a bug-eyed,Raekwon-esque flow, snares that sound ripped from dusty dollar-bin LPs, echoing horn samples, and the feeling of cold clinging to concrete buildings.Gorgeous Polo Sportsmenwas Raz’s first full-length collaboration with another producer, and though he’s since notched excellent records with Dibia$e,Nicholas Craven, andDJ Muggs, they feel like warm-ups for this rematch. Perhaps it’s their shared Toronto postal code, their respective years of practice, or a shared vision of throwback prestige rap, but Raz and Futurewave both sound more comfortable than they have in some time."

    "review_text": "In 1960,Françoise Hardysurprised her family—twice. First, she passed her baccalauréat exam with flying colors, a shock, really. Then, for her reward, she chose a guitar over a transistor radio. The radio had seemed the obvious fit: The introverted 16-year-old adored her piped-in tunes, becoming obsessed with chanson singers like Jacques Brel and then the English-language songs broadcast on Radio Luxembourg. Years later, Hardy likened her discovery of British and American pop artists like Paul Anka, Brenda Lee, and Cliff Richard to acoup de foudre(thunderbolt). “I immediately identified with them, because they expressed teenage loneliness and awkwardness over melodies that were much more inspiring than their texts,” she later wrote in her memoir. A guitar was a vehicle for her own self-expression and Hardy quickly began writing her own material, rare for a pop singer at that time.\nIn 1962, after signing a deal with Disques Vogues, Hardy encouraged her label to promote one of her self-written songs, a wistful number called “Tous les garçons et les filles” (“All the Boys and Girls”). By the time she released herfull-length debuta few months later, the song was an unexpected hit in France. The melancholic “Tous les garçons” set Hardy apart from bright-eyed contemporaries like France Gall and Sylvie Vartan. If the other yé-yé girls sang candy-colored love songs, here was Hardy, shyly peering out from behind her long bangs, lamenting the loneliness of her soul: “Et les yeux dans les yeux/Et la main dans la main/Ils s’en vont amoureux/Sans peur du lendemain” (“And eyes in eyes/And hand in hand/They walk in love/Without fear of tomorrow”).\nBy 1965, “the yéh-yéh girl from Paris” was a star overseas, earning her first and only English-language hit with a song titled “All Over the World.” Though Hardy was a natural homebody, she still found ways to enjoy her celebrity. She delighted in turning heads inavant-garde ensemblesby modern fashion designers Paco Rabanne and André Courrèges. She did the movie star thing, appearing in films by Roger Vadim and John Frankenheimer. A cameo appearance in Jean-Luc Godard’s 1966 new wave filmMasculin féminincemented her spot as a generational icon. But theideaof Françoise Hardy often eclipsed the woman herself. “More than a singer, she’s becoming a universal myth with whom thousands of young girls dream of identifying,” opined the French magazineSpecial Popin 1967.\nAs she matured, Hardy came to resent her early work and considered the arrangements “terrible.” “I listened to that record and I was so dissatisfied,” she once said of “Tous les garçons,” “and I have been dissatisfied very often ever since.” As soon as she had some acclaim under her belt, Hardy convinced Disques Vogue to let her record in London with the pop arranger Charles Blackwell and his orchestra. Hardy’s mid-’60s records reflect this superior production as she dabbled in balladry, baroque pop, and blues, releasing albums sung in Italian and English. She was well-prepared for the emerging singer-songwriter era—she had, after all, been doing both—and collaborated with a variety of fine songwriters, includingSerge Gainsbourg."

    "review_text": "The American Girl is an expensive doll. She comes packaged with a history that follows a tidy narrative trajectory: She has and will overcome obstacles with grace, poise, and beauty. She will know no prolonged sadness, nor wonder as to her purpose. These are the promises on which she was raised. She knows the longer she stays in her box, the more she’s worth. But if she looks out at the world long enough, she’ll realize she’s only ever seen it through a warped plastic window. What’s an American girl to do?\nSince her 2018 breakthrough,In a Poem Unlimited, the response of Meg Remy—the sole member ofU.S. Girls—has been to embrace the hyperreal. Like a version of Neo who returns to the Matrix and becomes Patrick Bateman, she swallows up the plastic exploitation of the last six decades of American pop music and flaunts its excesses. If it’s typically impossible to tell when she’s satirizing and when she’s simply feeling the pleasure of singing and moving her body to a well-made song, that ambiguity is probably the point. OnScratch It, her most immediate and accessible album, she leaves the ’80s electro-funk of 2023’sBless This Messbehind and remakes herself as a mid-’60s country crooner in a shimmering skirt. While it calls to mindCat Power’s Memphis masterpieceThe Greatestand the haunted beehive ofCindy Lee’sDiamond Jubilee,Scratch Itbuzzes with a chattering methamphetamine sleaziness, as much Vegas as it is Nashville. TheTNNstudio lights that frame this record are so hot, they make the music sweat.\nAs with most U.S. Girls albums, sweating is what this music most wants to do. Remy’s project is conceptually heavy, but what’s kept her uncanny avant-pop from being some tedious academic exercise—or, worse, a ribald pomo take on established styles—is that she always remembers to bring her body with her: “Under the street there is a beach,” she sings in 2023’s “Only Daedalus,” whose slinky quiet storm beat is a reminder that the situationists who turned that phrase into the slogan of the 1968 student protests saw pleasure as the end goal of liberation.\nOnScratch It, she’s looser than ever before, letting the contradictions arise naturally rather than spelling them out. “James said you gotta dance till you feel better,” she sings in the opening “Like James Said,” quoting “Get Up Offa That Thing” while cheekily calling the man who demanded to be addressed as “Mr. Brown” by his first name. She flips the gospel standard “Just a Closer Walk With Thee” into a jam about the freedom of a good fuck. “You had boots on/I had bare feet/It was a natural conspiracy,” she sings, aDavid Bermanopener delivered in a husky T-Boz register. “Firefly on the 4th of July” marches to a martial snap whose every beat is pillowed by a lead line from guitarist Dillon Watson that wanders and flits like a lazy bee. “Thank god I was looking good when I saw you,” Remy sings, a little sun drunk, delivering her lines with the relish of Jeannie C. Riley socking it to the Harper Valley PTA."

What we might call “leaves” on “trees” here are simply shades upon shades. Every difference is negated. Listening to it feels like waking up from anesthetic, an experience in which there is no delineation between self and other, inner and outer.\nTaba, the album’s title, is a Japanese term for bundling and sheafing, gathering material together. True to its name, the album sounds as though Satomimagae has extracted all the world’s resources and fed them into a juicer on quiet mode. Other than the rich open voicings of her guitar—the only distinguishable instrument on the album—it is difficult to determine the source of each sound; the electronic blurs into the acoustic, raw sounds blend into heavy audio manipulation. You’d be hard pressed to find a dominant emotion anywhere on the album, either. ButTaba’sstrength is in its indeterminacy: Its vagueness cathects a largeness of mood.\nWhile Satomimagae’s previous albums felt more insular, the outside world begins to creep in onTaba. She finds the resonances between the natural landscape and the subject experiencing it. On “Ishi,” brushy textures slide past one another while crickets tweedle in and out of focus. On “Many,” a foreboding drone creates a grounding force while Satomimagae sings a pleading melody which sounds like loneliness calcified. By track five, “Mushi Dance,” the meeting point between inner and outer becomes psychedelically absurd, the music terrifically strange. Phasers fill the gray space while chirping birds provide a counterpart to Satomimagae’s guitar, the boundaries between the human and avian disintegrated.\nWhile makingTaba, Satomimagae gave focused attention to the various sounds of life outside her home studio in Tokyo, carrying a recorder wherever she went. We hear, among many other things: crickets, birdsong, wind, waves, babbling brooks, children—all of which eventually become indistinguishable from Satomimagae’s own recording techniques and electronic effects. What sound like waves on “Metallic Gold’ might also be speakers deprived of a musical source, hissing out air. What sounds like a brook on “Spells” might be the liquidy click of a recorder turning on and off. Rather than depicting a static, predictable world, these songs find in nature a kind of unsettling dynamism that shifts, moves, transforms, and folds in on the self.\nThe relatively linear and lucid songwriting of Satomimagae’s previous albums gives way to something much more impressionistic and improvisatory. On “Omijinai”she hums idly, quietly establishing a pattern of tension and resolution between skeins of guitar. On “Tonbo,” her guitar is a textural tool, poised and paced, while equally capable of giving over to flights of spontaneous emotion. With one eye on the world, Satomimagae conjures her own shivery, bucolic ecosystem, inviting her listener to find in these sounds some kind of experiential truth. There is something essential and indescribable driving this music. You can’t quite put your finger on what it is, but at times it is so beautiful you could just about live off of it.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "It’s hard to say exactly what “country” means these days, but even if you can’t define it, you know it when you hear it. “Last Night” byMorgan Wallen—the biggest song of 2023, and the defining country crossover hit of the 2020s—is country to the extent that Wallen sings in a macho Tennessee accent, though its wispy fingersnap beat almost sounds like ringtone rap. Earlier singles like “7 Summers” and “More Than My Hometown”—both from the 2021 blockbusterDangerous: The Double Album—are no doubt country in their small-town love stories featuring fishing, beer, and God. But they remind me of the radio songs being piped into the pool where I worked in the early 2000s: a pleasant, vaguely poignant blur of pop and rock and country, the kind of thing that sounds today like simpler times.\nGrowing up in eastern Tennessee, the now 32-year-old Wallen was more of a Nickelback guy. “But once I started writing songs, it justsoundedcountry,” he told Kelefa Sanneh in a 2020New Yorkerprofile. “And I was like, well, I guess I’ll sing country music, because this is the life I know.” Five years later, Wallen is by far the biggest name in country at a time when the genre’s more popular than it’s been in decades; his last two records,Dangerousand 2023’sOne Thing at a Time, are the only albums in history to spend at least 100 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. How does the man who recently fled New York City with the parting message, “Get me to God’s country,” feel about all this? If the 37 songs ofI’m the Problemare any indication—well, not great! Instead, success and its accompanying scrutiny seem to have turned Wallen inward, resulting in his most paranoid album, and maybe his truest.\nHistorically, the sound of a Morgan Wallen single—and by extension, the sound of the country charts—is smoother than the souped-up bro-country of the 2010s: all earworm hooks and aerodynamic verses that tumble into one another so that the momentum never fades. It’s clever the way “Last Night” opens right into the chorus, or the myriad entendres of 2018’s “Whiskey Glasses,” one of his many boozy breakup anthems. (“Poor me,” he head-fakes on the intro, then shifts course: “Pour me another drink.”) Nearly all of Wallen’s hits involve a doomed romance, which he is either actively demolishing or drinking to forget. You might describe the kind of love that Wallen sings about as toxic, though within all the drama is a passion that recalls the desperate lotharios of ’90s R&B, as if he’s throwing rocks up at your window in the rain."

    "review_text": "Have you seenthat videogoing around the website formerly known as Twitter, where a young MGMT ecstatically perform their yet-to-be hit “Kids” on Wesleyan’s Westco courtyard? The two musicians fidget with their synths and read nervously from a lyric sheet, oblivious to the crowd of barefoot college kids captivated in front of them on the lawn. That clip spread widely in part because it evoked a supposedly halcyon period of collegiate sincerity, when making your friends dance felt like the only thing that mattered, “mp3 blogs” produced a seemingly limitless rotation of buzzy new bands, and the border between making art and throwing a party was porous at best.\nA few years later and one state over, Fang Island was born into that same halogenic atmosphere. The band formed in 2005 as a class credit at the Rhode Island School of Design—“We got a ‘B+’ on the project and thought that was worthy of pursuing,” guitarist and keyboardist Chris Georgeslater recalled. In the group’s relatively brief existence, Georges, vocalist and guitarist Jason Bartell, and drummer Marc St. Sauveur bottled up their disinhibition with a rotating cast of bandmates and brought it to sweaty Manhattan rock clubs like Santos Party House and Cake Shop. Their boundless energy fit a scene built on intimate venues and blogs with loyal followings, where a few passionate voices or a great show at SXSW could change the trajectory of a band’s career. But only a few years after Fang Island’s debut, the band quietly faded out, its members growing out of touring and into jobs and families. A decade after the band’s dissolution, enterDoesn’t Exist II: The Complete Recordings: a reissued and remastered box set of Fang Island’s entire catalog. It’s a three-guitar salute for America’s most relentlessly joyful blog-rock band.\nWith more guttural cheers than words, Fang Island sounded like aCheap Trickrecord left out to melt on a hot summer’s day, or a confetti cannon going off at aThin Lizzyconcert, or the day they bring thebig parachuteinto gym class. Their 2006 EPDay of the Great Leap, released here for the first time on vinyl alongside the 2008 EPSky Gardens, reverberates with echoes of Providence noise rock: “We Were Lions” vibrates with the kinetic energy of local heroes Lightning Bolt, riffs darting up the fretboard like the band is planning a heist; the fevered paranoia of Les Savy Fav creeps in on “Meateater.” There are no vocals onDay of the Great Leap, and navigating its hooks feels a bit like walking a familiar path at dusk: Even without the usual markings of rock catharsis—a screamed lyric, an impassioned bridge—you can anticipate and relish the intensity of the breakdown on “Vlad” all the same. Their guitars alone offered a stream of exclamations, a “Hell yeah!” amplified by three pedal boards."

    "review_text": "Grills, guitars, Auto-Tune, CS:GO gameplay footage,Wisp, flashing lights, shooting guns, skeletons, scuzzy CCTV shots. In the overstimulating music video for “I Heard You,” nu-gaze and SoundCloud rap congeal into an onslaught of digital debris, like an A24 take oncorecore. The mastermind is Max Epstein, a Los Angeles workaholic whose rap sheet—live guitar forJane Removerand quannnic, production for post-emo prodigies like daine andBlair—often outshines his own feverish output. But within the vast sprawl of his collaborations, his spunky solo catalog feels like a buried treasure. His latest and lengthiest LP, the 18-trackI look at her and light goes all through me, is equal parts guitar album and producer tape: feature-flecked, genre-agnostic, scattered, and sincere. Across 30-odd searing minutes, Epstein synthesizes his impulses, allowing his frenzied vision free rein. The result is a delightfully dizzying collage, not unlike the “I Heard You” music video: shards of inchoate ideas, cascading until the clamor becomes cathartic.\nBusy as Epstein is,I look at herscans as a document of his downtime: hours spent fiddling with old demos, jamming on tour buses, dreaming on studio floors. He pays the bills by nudging peers towards their voices, but his back-catalog betrays a years-long struggle to find his own. His earliest releases as Photographic Memory, which date back to 2014, brim with hazy slowcore, like a (very) low-budget take onDuster. As his footprint expanded, his sound followed suit:Everything Nice, his 2018 mixtape, compiled fleeting bedroom demos; 2021’seponymous LPsported a fuller feel, though without shedding his early sadness-soup songcraft. (Arpeggios! Auto-Tune! Abjection!) It’s bad practice to judge an album by its cover, but his aesthetic identity has long suggested the subtlety of a peripheral figure. Take thealbum artfor said eponymous LP, a dusky, out-of-focus take onEither/Or. Intentional or not, the allusion is telling of its contents: a young guitarist shrouded in the shadows of his peers and influences.\nButI look at heris not the triumphant, swaggering comeback album in which the reclusive unsung hero finally roars. And this isn’t at all bad. Epstein has managed to distill his defining qualities—production prowess, spotlight aversion, frenetic collaboration—into a vivid snapshot of digital music in 2025, when producer tags, power chords, live instruments and Ableton plugins coexist in chaotic harmony. Perhaps the most effective voice for Photographic Memory is that of the auteur, the half-visible center of an immersive experience. Fittingly, the most brilliant moment on this project is not a solo track, but “Heartsyle,” a glistening single in which Wisp flits over an Epstein-produced plugg beat. It is disarmingly odd; like much ofI look at her, it basks in the strange collisions forged by an amorphous, oversaturated era. I laughed the first time I heard “Recently,” in whichGucci Maneraps “Woppenheimer” over what sounds like a scrappedTired of Tomorrowdemo. The next time I played it, I realized that it was really, really beautiful.\nBeautiful, too, is Epstein’s voice, which sounds stronger here than it ever has. While his vocal timbre—something like a lonely, androgynous android—has remained relatively consistent over the past few years, the textures onI look at hergrant it more room to command. Digi-rock epic “Clearly” is a loud-quiet-loud stomper, all twinkling synth stabs, soft acoustic pluckage, and the occasional pulsating kick. At certain points, it risks scanning as aSnow Strippersremix of “Fireflies.” But what rescues the song from its potential pitfalls—overstimulation and ennui—is the push-and-pull between Epstein’s voice and production, a complex soundscape braved by a careful, somewhat childlike protagonist. Regardless of your definition of “nu-gaze” (“new shoegaze” or “shoegaze à la nu-metal”), there’s something on this record for members of all sects: compare the glitchy pathos of “Emo Tour Track” to the growling thrash of “Love in My Heart.” Epstein the singer is undergirded by Epstein the producer, who is undergirded by Epstein the curator. When these multiple selves converge here, their handiwork is the strongest proof yet of his singular vision."

    "review_text": "WhenRichard Dawsonfinished his trilogy of epic, state-of-the-nation concept albums—set in the pre-medieval past (Peasant), present (2020), and future (The Ruby Cord)—he seemingly left himself with nowhere new to go. The series was absurdly ambitious, from his painstaking historical research forPeasanttoThe Ruby Cord’s 41-minute opener to his grand palette of strings, electronics, and group vocals.End of the Middlescales things back into austere, intimate folk songs that center on Dawson’s guitar and broad, oaky voice, supported by Andrew Cheetham’s bare-bones drums and Faye MacCalman’s clarinet.\nRather than depart from the trilogy,End of the Middledevelops its central idea that history echoes itself. Dawson frames the conceit within modern families, examining the ways generations relate unsteadily to each other amid damaging patterns of behavior. The smaller scale liberates his best qualities—his knack for realism, pathos, and humor—in an insightful, compassionate album that cements him among the UK’s great contemporary folk artists. InEnd of the Middle,neglected kids become imperfect parents, and every adult is also someone’s child.\nDawson has a keen ear for the ways people speak. His lyrics spill conversationally across bars, and his acrobatic voice magnifies emotions and cadences natural to his sentences. “I wish I had gone on to higher education,” he sings as a grandmother in “Gondola,” rising to a crushing note of half-smiling resignation: “But Tom was always the clever one.” He also has an eye for colorful details, like the wedding-ring bearer in “Knot”: “Waddling down the aisle comes a golden retriever, in a waistcoat and dickie bow,” he sings, over a rising finger-plucked guitar melody.\nDrawing out stories across generations, Dawson captures the way memories loom large in the present. “Bullies” presents a child isolated by school bullies—“I’m in the library every lunchtime,” Dawson sings in a quavering falsetto—who later in the song, as an adult, discovers their own son is a bully. It’s an emotional gut punch, and when the speaker finally tells their son, “I know you’ve got a good heart,” over the last stumbling guitar notes, it partially registers as an attempt to forgive their old tormentors. Similarly, the account of moving house to start a family in “Removals Van” features vivid snapshots of the speaker’s childhood home falling apart, coloring the last line—“It won’t be long till the baby arrives”—with the fear that history might repeat itself.\nEnd of the Middle’s simple palette helps Dawson flatten the past and present. While MacCalman’s clarinet adds occasional color, crying in “Bullies” and babbling furiously after the argument in “Knot,” the mix of guitar, drums, and vocals gives these stories familiar, consistent framing. It also dulls more distressing moments, like the daughter haunted by a ghost in “The Question,” just as we get used to living with old pains."

Twenty-seven minutes long, yet it felt like it had just started playing a few moments before.GULPpacks a lot of ideas into its seven tracks, but surely that couldn’t be it? In the world of dance music LPs, individual tracks usually run between six and eight minutes.GULPfelt different, lasting about as long as fizzy water stays bubbly and fresh in the glass. But after a few more listens, that turned out to be its strength. There are no moments wasted, no tracks that wear out their welcome with one too many loops, no flab to speak of.GULPis bite-sized house music, making a statement with memorable hooks and bold basslines, and then making way for the next idea to take over.\nGULPlands onWisdom Teeth, the label Facta runs with fellow LondonerK-LONE. Over time, the imprint has developed a cozy style that’s as colorful as a lovingly handmade patchwork quilt. Their sound encompasses UK garage, drum’n’bass, post-dubstep and, increasingly, the kind of twitchy, detail-oriented minimal dance music that’s part of an ongoing global revival.Pattern Gardening, the label’s most recent compilation, fashioned itself as the manifesto for this movement. Wisdom Teeth gathered producers from France to Japan to put their spin on the label’s homey, sometimes cutesy minimal sound, and came out with something era-defining in the process.\nFacta’s LP pulls back a little—or a lot.Pattern Gardeningwas over two hours long, whileGULPis barely longer than an episode ofSeinfeld. It’s built with the same DNA asPattern Gardening, but comes out in spurts of inspiration rather than luxuriating in intricate grooves. After the requisite one-minute intro track, “BDB” comes barreling out with an obnoxious vocal hook over a track that splits the difference between early Perlon and modern Afro house. The bass is tidal, the drums huge—and the vocal as belligerently insistent as some of thebiggest hitsof the original minimal era, but with more charm this time around.\nEach track onGULPhas some kind of outsized hook. These are big shiny tunes that stick in the mind. “Skyline” is all dreamy beats and dewy FM synthesis, the melody landing and fading like condensation on glass. “SLoPE” is a topsy-turvy jam built on jazzy samples—like a drum’n’bass track disassembled and put back together incorrectly—while “Jets,” the highlight, combines twitchy minimal house with an enormous bassline that almost upends the otherwise supple groove. And with that, I’ve mentioned almost all the tracks. But they’re moreish enough to warrant going back again and again."

    "review_text": "The ringtone rap era still feels like the wildest fever dream in hip-hop. Like, did it really happen? Yes, it did. By the mid-2000s, song-buying options had dramatically expanded to include not just CDs but also legal downloads, with iTunes monopolizing the digital market and record labels making billions off turning the catchiest parts of their artists’ singles into 99-cent ringtones—a step up from the sparse polyphonic MIDI tunes of the past. And a 22-year-old Tallahassee Pain was widely recognized as the campy, charismatic maestro of the pitch-correction software Auto-Tune; even if he didn’t invent it, he was largely responsible for its newfound prevalence in pop, and there was no turning back. Every rap hookT-Paincrooned over—alongsidePlies,E-40,Kanye West,andevenFlo Rida—was gilded, contributing to his title as the de facto ringtone king.\nThe coronation was, of course, fleeting. T-Pain’s early ballads, “I’m Sprung” and “I’m N Luv (Wit a Stripper),” sold a staggering 6.7 million ringtones combined in 2005, the same yearBillboardbegan tracking digital download sales and right before the RIAA introduced gold and platinum certification for ringtones. Those ringtone sales significantly outpaced both his album sales and digital downloads. (His 2005 debut,Rappa Ternt Sanga, went gold but never platinum.) “I had people at Jive tell me they didn’t believe in my product and let me know that they didn’t too much care,” T-Pain said at the time. “But selling 6.7 million ringtones… changed their minds.” By the end of 2007, he’d earned his first and only No. 1 hit as a solo artist and the year’s best-selling ringtone for his bleary breakup elegy “Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin’),” while the song’s parent album,Epiphany, struggled to achieve gold status.\nEven in a rapidly changing digital landscape, physical album sales were still the benchmark of a hit, and T-Pain couldn’t survive on just making club gospel for millennial flip phones. ThoughRappa Ternt Sangahad felt like electro-soul innovation, pop listeners weary of the robot sound were coming to see T-Pain less as a trendsetter and more as a gimmick without a real voice. With his second album,Epiphany, he hoped to change people’s minds. “I’ve made club songs, and I’ve made radio songs, and I’ve made the car songs. These songs are T-Pain songs,” he told theAssociated Pressahead of the album’s June 2007 release. “If people like this album, that means they like me as a person.”"

    "review_text": "Ever lock your gaze on afractal animationand have the dizzying impression you were tumbling into the screen? The British multimedia artist Lucas Dupuy’s recent exhibitionOne panoramic view after another will unfoldoperates on a similar principle. His artworks begin as airbrush studies, which he then photographs and rephotographs, zooming in on smaller and smaller details, drilling down to microscopic levels of granularity. Only at the end of this iterative process does he hit solid ground: Having achieved the desired tangle of lines, he pulls out his pigments and paints the ropy forms on heavy burlap, the fabric’s pits and threads giving the piece a three-dimensional, larger-than-life quality.\nIf Dupuy’s paintings are a way of removing the artist’s hand from the equation, the same goes forHEAL, his collaboration with the Berlin-based ambient musicianPavel Milyakov(akaButtechno). This is not their first time working together; that’s Dupuy’s artwork on the cover ofpmxper, Milyakov’s 2023 album withPerila, part of a visual discography that also includes sleeves for labels like AD 93, Warm Winters Ltd., and Muscut. This time, Dupuy took part in the music as well.HEALbegan with a collection of the British artist’s synthesizer sketches, along with field recordings he made in Japan; he passed those off to Milyakov, who fed the lot throughQuantum, a custom-built software instrument whose complex modulations and unpredictable signal paths are designed to coax surprising mutations out of sampled material. Like Dupuy with his scanner and paintbrushes, Milyakov became part editor, part composer, part conductor of a synthetic orchestra with a mind of its own.\nThe results, however, sound anything but chaotic. Chalk that up, perhaps, to Milyakov’s own predilection for ambient at its gauziest. The album’s palette is heavy on vaporous synthesizer pads, gentle chimes, and cottony clouds of white noise; its rhythms churn with the slow, reassuring regularity of rolling surf. The artists say that they were inspired by ’90s ambient and new age—in particular, the pastel synthscapes ofSt.GIGA, a bygone Japanese satellite radio broadcaster famous for itslongform ambient and environmental shows—and you can certainly hear those influences inHEAL’s balmy drift. Birdsong and running water trace winding routes through “path,” a snapshot of forest idyll illuminated by soft major chords. Downtuned pan pipes bob lazily through “Flutes of Doom,” whose muggy psychedelia suggests a vintage new-age cassette, still sheathed in its yellowing shrinkwrap, lying between tarnished crystals and dried-out sticks of palo santo in a shopworn Woodstock hippie emporium."

    "review_text": "Lust for Youthwere never quite as frigid as they seemed. Even on 2012’sGrowing Seeds, the minimalist, abrasive solo debut of Swedish producer Hannes Norrvide, a song like “Champagne” yearned to pop a cork and hit the dancefloor. And by the time thecoldwaverevival began to thaw, Norrvide’s project had expanded twice—first intoa duowith Malthe Fischer, thena trio, bringing in Posh Isolation label co-founder Loke Rahbek—and begun to dip its toes into the warmer waters ofbeach discoandbalearic pop.All Worlds, the group’s new full-length collaboration with Rahbek’sCroatian Amormoniker, finally commits to a decade-plus’ worth of flirtations: This is a summer record through and through, engineered for windows-down car rides along the coast, beachside cabana bars, and Ibiza discothèques. As soundtrack, mood music, vibe,All Worldsflourishes; under closer inspection, it can resemble a lesser sum of its references. Tantalizing but not always satisfying, the album summons a series of itches that the songs can’t quite scratch.\nRahbek departed Lust for Youth some time between 2016’sCompassionand 2019’sDepeche Mode-worshippingself-titled record, meaning the split-billedAll Worldsdoubles as a full-band reunion. After so much collaboration and mutual influence, it’s not always clear where Norrvide and Fischer’s work ends and Croatian Amor’s begins. All three are fond of widescreen, echoing guitars and driving lite-industrial rhythms, though 2013’s excellentPomegranate, the last LP credited to both acts, forayed into new age-y ambiance. The new album doesn’t sound likePomegranate; instead, it island hops fromDJ Koze’s bucolic techno (“Kokiri”) toAir France’s seaside sampledelia (“Dummy”) toJamie xx’s pirate radio two-step (“Fleece”). “Passerine” stands out as new territory for the trio—aCocteau Twinsrip so uncanny that you could layer in Elizabeth Fraser’s “Iceblink Luck” glossolalia practically unchanged. In stretching to encompass a universally sun-drenched ideal,All Worldssometimes feels like a singles compilation instead of a unified statement.\nThis is, at least in part, by design. While makingAll Worlds, Norrvide, Fischer, and Rahbek drew inspiration from theGolden Recordaboard the 1977 Voyager space probes, etched with photographs, multilingual greetings, and sounds of Earth ostensibly aimed at an extraterrestrial audience. What press materials describe as the trio’s attempt to capture a “kaleidoscopic view of the human experience” ends up like a veritable inkblot test for the last 20 years of indie dance. Tilt opening track “Friendzone” one way and catch the shearing synths that could’ve been lifted whole-cloth fromRustie’sGlass Swords; another and the hesitant, digitized vocal sample starts to sound likeSOPHIE’s “Infatuation.” These phantoms crop up throughout, gestures at nostalgia that tend to come off a bit stock. The spoken first line of “Lights in the Center” (“Round rock… it’s where we’d hide and smoke cigarettes”) hints atyouthfulescapismà laM83, but the accompanying song—a water balloon of beatific, aimless noise that keeps filling up until it spontaneously deflates—doesn’t know how to deliver on them."

Last fall, she lit upCharli XCXandTroye Sivan’sSweat Tourafter unleashing her sleek, six-track EPClub Shyin February. Its high-energy dance songs hit with the potency of agay pour, and her profound, mallrat lyricism dilated pupils with unpredictable lines like, “Who wants to be real/I just want to be fake.” Like body glitter in your bed, her minimal words linger and provoke; though shefrequentlyinsists her approach to this synthetic music isn’t meant to bethatdeep, its silicone still gets implanted under the muscle.\nIn March 2024, she released her DJ set recorded at the legendary fabric London, proving she’s more than just an exquisite performer—Shygirl is a master curator. Even more, she’s evolved into a Y2K-filtered Oracle of Delphi, dropping sensual, philosophical bangers with the same finesse as texting the group chat on a Razr. But where last year’s release was cut for the chaotic white-twink-wasted crowd—trotting to frenetic techno or blissing out to trance on tabletops—Club Shy Room 2feels like something else entirely. It’s as if you’ve been invited to sit at the Unfriendly Black Hotties’ table, where shaking ass and slow whining is reserved for those who can actually keep up.\nRoom 2is an experimental Black femme imagining of what lies behindClub Shy’s velvet VIP rope: Champagne cheersing to you and your homegirls’ collective slay as a soundsystem’s bass beads sweat down your back. A little classy pregame turns into a dirty martini, which turns into rapping a few verses with the besties. And at barely 15 minutes, its exclusive guestlist ensures that only the boldest make the cut—like Toronto’s rising electronic trailblazerBAMBII. “Flex” turns into a bad ting charm school, with BAMBII and Shygirl devouring a haunted-ass trap beat as they spit tutorials on how to pop your shit. Its violins and organs dip into dark academia, with a twist of early aughts hip-hop when the Timbaland-like flutes drop in. The pulsing hook, “hot, steady, tight,” sounds exactly like what 2000s music videos promised going out would feel like—glamourous, magnetic, and soundtracked by euphoric, stilettos-on-the-couch music.\nShygirl’s ability to cook cutesy, juvenile references into grown and sexy club candy shines on “Wifey Riddim.” Its vintage lunchroom table production, evoking Lil Mama’s “Lip Gloss” orGwen Stefani’s “Hollaback Girl,” gets a refreshing update with the addition of hip-rocking Jersey club breakdowns. Joining her isSadBoi, another rising Toronto artist running its highly experimental and distinctly Caribbean electronic scene. Her command of the mic—“Give me that ring/Let the gyaldem know”—channels the spoiled princess energy from her latest album,DRY CRY, a fusion of baile funk, Jamaican patois, and West Indian influences. As if that weren’t enough,Jorja Smithslides in with her effortless Walsall swagger, staking her claim as wifey alongside Shygirl on the chorus. “You like me the way I am/Don’t need to change a thing,” Smith sings: two unmarried British body queens sharing a knowing giggle. InRoom 2, being wifey is a state of mind."

    "review_text": "Franz Ferdinandtransitioned gracefully to legacy act. That they were a retro band from the start, intoxicated by new wave danciness and Britpop optimism, surely helped. Now in its third decade, the Glasgow quintet releaseda greatest hits albumin 2022 but resisted the lure of the 20th-anniversary tour last year when 2004’s indelible debut hit that milestone, prioritizing new material in setlists instead. They’ve never released an irredeemably bad album, never chased trends or hollow rebrands, even if in recent years their studio output has slowed to a trickle.\nThat, too, is a perk of legacy status: You don’t have to release an album every two years. These Scots don’t rush: The time elapsed since their fifth album, 2018’s peppy, disco-coloredAlways Ascending, is longer than the Great War sparked by the assassination of the Archduke. Now, at long last, comes a new album that sounds… a whole lot likeAlways Ascending.\nBreezy and unflappably upbeat, these tunes summon the vintage swagger and suave humor of Franz Ferdinand’s early records but little of the punkish exhilaration. Alex Kapranos is older and wiser: “Did you ever get the feeling that there’s something come undone?” he croons as “Audacious” kicks into pleasantly ruffled gear, still managing to marshall some anti-defeatist optimism for the McCartney-esque pop of the chorus (“Don’t stop feeling audacious/There’s no one to save us/So just carry on”). “Build It Up,” one of several songs co-written by keyboardist Julian Corrie, is funky and light on its feet, with a chorus that packs enough momentum for festival stages.\nA loose concept givesThe Human Fearsome shape and purpose. Kapranos describes it as “a bunch of songs searching for the thrill of being human via fears.” Not that there’s much soul-baring here; like his Britpop forebears, Kapranos specializes in character sketches and sardonic vignettes instead. On “The Doctor,” he cheekily plays a hospital patient who refuses to go home: “I have nurses I can talk to and thermometers to hold.” “Bar Lonely” offers vignettes from a sad-sack watering hole where “everybody here is alone, just like you,” though handclaps and hookybah-bah-bah-bahs keep it light.\nStill, for an album ostensibly inspired by terror and thrill,The Human Fearplays it pretty safe. The songs are amiable and easygoing, with plenty of hooks but few big swings; there’s not much to trigger an adrenaline shock. Only on “The Birds,” a spiky, post-punk curveball of a closer, does the band wig out and summon some real anxiety. Otherwise, when Franz Ferdinand stray from their comfort zone, the results are embarrassing (the electroclash misfire “Hooked,” outfitted with an EDM drop) or just nearly weird enough to entertain (the klezmer-inspired curio “Black Eyelashes”)."

    "review_text": "Eddie Chacon was in the studio when his life began anew. He was there at the request of Capitol Records to assist his labelmate, the late Charles Pettigrew, recording vocal takes that the latter would sing over. But when playing back the track, the engineer forgot to pull out Chacon’s voice and the two were heard together. “It gave you chills,” Chaconrecently toldMonocle, but his feelings were complicated. “I had a combination of euphoria and incredible sadness.” He’d been in the industry for some time—he’d make a record and it’d get shelved, he’d make another and it wouldn’t sell—and it became clear that the only way forward was to put his dreams of a solo career aside. Charles & Eddie, the ’90s soul duo that nabbed aglobal chart topper, would be his foreseeable future.\nThere is a gratitude that Chacon expresses acrossLay Low, his third solo LP, that comes with this acceptance of life’s circuitous paths. “Maybe that’s the way it’s supposed to be,” he sings on the hushed title track, an impressively calm statement for someone who, as he later confesses, “think[s] about thinking way too much.” After Chacon and Pettigrew called it quits in the late ’90s, Chacon wrote Scandinavian pop songs with the Danish producer Poul Bruun, but felt lost and eventually abandoned music altogether. It wasn’t until he met producerJohn Carroll Kirbyin 2018 that he felt reinvigorated to make his first solo album,Pleasure, Joy and Happiness.\nMore than his previous records,Lay Lowfocuses on the clarity that arrives with age and time. You can hear the proof in Chacon’s songwriting, which has sharpened to an impressively minimalist degree. Many of these songs are little more than glossy, barebones sophisti-pop tracks with hypnotic refrains. “I just miss you home,” he sings tenderly on the opener, “Good Sun.” He calls to his late mother, reaching through the chasm with soft whispers and curlicue melodies. To hear Chacon repeat this line is to witness transformation; he elegantly captures how reminiscing offers bittersweet comfort. He’s on shakier emotional ground in “Let You Go,” but he paints this meandering search as necessary: The song ends with his voice dissipating, like he’s accepted the truth of her absence.\nLay Lowwas built on this need to move forward. At its inception, Kirby told Chacon that they wouldn’t do another full-album collaboration with him, leading Chacon to tap producerNick Hakim, who’s made albums filled with gauzy, psychedelic soul. You can see Chacon’s transition in the songs bearing each producer’s feature credit. The funky “Empire,” with Kirby, glistens more than any other track—its tempo and groove provide the album’s only upbeat uplift. “Birds,” with Hakim, is moodier and characteristic of the producer’s effects-laden works. Chacon sings amidst digital fog, delivering something of a soulful and restrainedBon Ivertrack. It also bears the most arresting “la la la”s on the album, which are simple, bare, and left to rest on one’s ear. You can hear the sweetness and emotional heft in his delivery—thoughtful and effortless in equal measure.\nHakim’s influence is most directly felt on “Let the Devil In,” which sounds as if Chacon is caught in a maze of textured synths. Chacon sings with a sort of warbled cadence that recalls the enigmatic Canadian singerLewis, where emotion is felt in the space between words, in the speed with which he moves through phrases. That he sounds a bit like a preacher is apt for a song about the apocalyptic state of the world. Similar themes arise on “End of the World,” a song that sounds likeMac DeMarcodoing reggae. As it lopes around with a surprising nonchalance, it reaffirms where Chacon’s journey has led him: to a place where he can survive change, where he can sing, “It feels like the end of the world as we know it” with a semblance of peace.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Frombeat-based electronic musictobellicose experimental art popandfantastical synth works, the electronic project is an outlet for Wiesenfeld to develop his own niche interests and evolving musicianship. His music pitches between earnest, puckish, and heart-rending, often within the same effervescent four minutes. OnGut, Wiesenfeld’s fourth Baths LP and first in eight years, the multi-hyphenate pivots again by filling out his sound with strident guitars, strings, and percussion. Combined with lyrics that detail the highs and lows of queer life with astonishing vulnerability, it’s among one of the most fully realized and exhilarating Baths albums to date.\nWiesenfeld refers toGutas “stomach music,” referring to lyrics that approach a flux of raw emotions without fear or shame, a first-thought-best-thought approach that teeters between gusts of aggression and ruminative quiet. Wiesenfeld balances the back-and-forth through frank lyrics that break new ground in his music. Here, he’s openly indulging in lust, “fucking all the men in droves” amid a polyphony of buzzing background vocals on the nervy “Sea of Men”; on mid-album standout “Eden,” his voice volleys around jittery synth melodies as he spirals out with radiant lust. “I am what he’ll be drinking/I’m a spring/Cupped to his lips,” he sings, slipping into straightforward desire: “I’m the sweat/Pressed on his tits/Slip into my ellipsis.” The brasher lyrics allow him to confront sex, isolation, and self-immolation with bracing candor.\nGutbrings different elements of Wiesenfeld’s usual sound to the fore. TheIsaura String Quartet, a Los Angeles ensemble that appeared on 2017’sRomaplasm, bolster a number of tracks with fluttering violin, cello, and viola. A swarm of violins circle Wisenfeld’s voice on “Sea of Men,” while the crisscrossing guitar and cello on “Verity” create friction beneath vivid lyrics depicting moonlight on yellow teeth and sunbleached plastic. With heavier guitars in the mix, Wiesenfeld also brings a new muscularity to his sound. He has mentioned being inspired by acts likeProtomartyrandGilla Band, influences that can be found on the tense, stuttering riffs that chug through “Peacocking,” underscoring the song’s unabashed neediness. Thudding percussion sounds like a fitful, ruptured drumline during the centerpiece “American Mythos,” where Wiesenfeld catalogs a relationship’s failings, whether it’s lack of trust or just finding his partner’s friends annoying. “I hate us/And I hate it all,” he admits in an airy falsetto against a swell of violins at the song’s end, a forthright confession set to a taut, post-punk patchwork."

    "review_text": "No one will ever explain the core appeal ofDef Leppardmore accurately than this lyrical excerpt taken from theband’s website:\n“Women!”\n[guitar solo]\nThe song is called “Women,” and there is no better way to introduce the most expensive album ever created at the time.\nBut for nearly a year, the mostsuccessfulalbum of its time began with the sound of failure.Hysteriaspun off enough inescapable hits to make over half its 63-minute runtime instantly familiar to anyone within earshot of a July 4th classic-rock block. The lead single wasn’t one of them. Def Leppard were, above all else, worried about the metal cred they forfeited the moment they showed up on MTV looking like themselves, i.e., aVan Halenthat more closely resembledDuran Duran.\nSo in thevideofor “Women,” Def Leppard play a bunch ofschmos in a box factory, a far cry from who they’d become by 1989’sLive: In the Round, In Your Face—the most successful starting five to hold court in the homes of the Denver Nuggets and Atlanta Hawks. “Women” peaked at No. 80 on the American charts and isn’t included onVault,the 1995 greatest-hits package that includes previously unreleased tracks and something fromThe Last Action Hero.It’s still an awe-inspiring teaser of Def Leppard’s state-of-the-art pop metal, a song that might be more beloved if it had been the seventh single, rather than the first. “I heard thatStevie WonderandPrincehad commented on how great it had sounded when they first heard it,” guitarist Phil Collentold Apple Music, which, I need receipts here. Some albums are too big to fail, but “Women” is a necessary reminder thatHysteriaonce appeared doomed to failurebecauseit was too big—the work of a band that lived out their dreams of being the nextLed Zeppelinonly after pulling the Hindenburg out of a tailspin.\nAt this point, even the most casual Def Leppard fans can recount the beats ofHysteria’stragic origin story more readily than the lyrics of “Pour Some Sugar on Me.” Singer Joe Elliott contracted mumps as a grown-ass man and, naturally, was worried about its notorious side effects on the “nether regions” (“They swell up like elephant balls,” he informedRolling Stone). IfHysteria’s lyrics (and tour lore) are to be believed, Elliott did just fine for himself. Guitarist Steve Clark was deep in polysubstance addiction that would take his life in 1991, yet the guitar parts onHysteriaare so pristine, they sound quantized. You cannot hear the hundreds of bottles of vodka and whiskey that littered the practice space."

    "review_text": "In their Feeling of the Day report, a recurring segment onKCRW,Brian EnoandBeatie Wolfeexplore the emotions as they are experienced in different languages, attempting to articulate feelings for which no words exist in English. Recent choices have includedduende, which they describe as shivering with thrill;eudaimonia, gratitude for things going well;ailyak, going slow and enjoying the process; anddor, longing or belonging. They’re all big and existential, the kinds of feelings that require wrestling with. Where better to unpack them than in song?\nThat is the driving question of the duo’s debut collaborative albums,LuminalandLateral. They frame the albums in terms similar to those of their Feeling of the Day report: They want to make music that elicits thorny and tangled emotions, the kind that aren’t always easy to articulate. Music, they offer, “is about making feelings happen,” a fairly obvious conclusion to draw. But while the uniqueness of hard-to-define feelings is the duo’s starting point, their music only rarely matches that complexity.\nEno and Wolfe share a longtime interest in the power of music to help us make sense of our inner worlds. The observation of feeling has been a central part of Eno’s practice. Music, he has proposed, should create a sense of calm, color the mood in a room, or give space for minds to wander. The idea has driven Eno’s series ofclassicambient albums and generative works likeDiscreet Music. Wolfe, a conceptual artist whose work frequently engages with science and technology, also touches on the power of feeling—considering, for example, the therapeutic value of music for people with neurological conditions likedementia.\nThough recorded piecemeal throughout 2024, both albums offer cohesive visions:Luminalis lush dream pop, andLateralwafting ambient. Both take a zoomed-out approach, focusing less on minute details and more on the sweeping effects of their melodies. OnLuminal, fuzzy vocals and tender instrumentals swirl into an amorphous cloud; onLateral, a simple repeating motif floats, nearly unchanging, for 64 minutes. In both cases, the music lacks nuance. Their straightforward melodies rarely shift or grow; the pulse is gentle; the dynamics hover around a comfortable mezzo-forte (with the occasional mezzo-piano, for variety). The music is characterized, above all, by its restraint; it sometimes feels as if the two musicians want to create the perfect feeling in a lab, rather than let it swallow them whole."

    "review_text": "At the end of 2015, a 23-year-oldMac Millerposted an unassuming cover of “Vienna,”Billy Joel’sStrangerclassic about taking things slowly and appreciating life while it’s right in front of us. Miller’s “Vienna” is slow and pitched-down, groggy and bathed in sadness. About a year earlier, he quietly recorded a suite of songs in a similarly melancholy mood. He ultimately shelved the tunes in favor of his major-label debut, 2015’sGO:OD AM, but the untouched recordings are now available asBalloonerism, the late Pittsburgh rapper’s second posthumous album. The new release is a missing link between Miller’s psychedelic hip-hop days and the smooth, nearly singer-songwriter path he explored on his final projects.\nThe music Miller made around the time ofBalloonerismwas a lot stranger and bolder than these 14 songs that he recorded in his Los Angeles home studio. His critical breakthrough, 2013’sWatching Movies With the Sound Off, was agitated and outlandish, an array of introspection, goofiness, bombast, and lyrical tongue-twisters, all delivered atop his most experimental production choices to date. He followed that album with a pair of mixtapes; first,Delusional Thomas, an alter-ego horrorcore project with spooky beats, knowingly perverted bars, and one ofEarl Sweatshirt’sbest-ever guest verses; thenFaces, released in 2014 not long after Miller tried out hisBalloonerismsongs. It is, in some respects, the peak of the Mac Miller project, overblown, as fun as it is painfully depressing, and earnest as could be. When Millersignedwith the label then known as Warner Bros. and made a highly polished album,GO:OD AM, he dialed back his self-destruction and highlighted his technical prowess. He was, by then, a veteran in his early twenties, ready to embark on the mature part of his career.\nStill,Balloonerismis not just detritus from a creative and productive era of Miller’s life. It’s a fully formed project that captures the rapper’s ability to make feel-good music from feelings that don’t necessarily feel good. “Mrs. Deborah Downer” is languid and jazzy, withThundercatplaying bass slowly and sweatily under Miller’s vocals and ramshackle drums. “Stoned” follows next and is cut from the same damp cloth. Neither should feel necessarily comforting but they both do, with the latter, in particular, finding a groove that’s nearly upbeat as Miller sings and raps as if he’s got no cares in the world."

    "review_text": "AcrossSasami’s first two albums, the Los Angeles songwriter drew impressively from a range of musical traditions: shoegaze’s wandering guitar riffs, nu metal’s gnashing arrangements, county-pop’s storytelling. The result was a dynamic, constantly evolving sound, which Sasami channeled to express introspection, frustration, and deep, almost mythological, yearning. On her new album,Blood on the Silver Screen, she commits to pop music’s campiness to convey the way love and heartache magnify even the most fleeting memories into heart-wrenching melodrama. It’s an interesting pivot, but much of the music feels too aimless to effectively deliver these intense emotions.\nSasami pulls inspiration from moments where the mundanity of suburban life takes on an unexpected, subsuming intensity—she’s cited gym music, strip malls, and CW show soundtracksas touchstones—and likewise, her music is most effective when her earnest, plainspoken lyrics escalate into theatrical gestures. On “Figure It Out,” a fairly straightforward love song about unconditional commitment, Sasami repeats the word “baby” with a building intensity that transforms the track into a revelation. Her vocals smoulder on top of explosive instrumentation: echoing synths, scampering drums, and a blazing guitar solo. Hearing her sing, you imagine flowers blooming in triple time. Similarly, on “Lose It All,” Sasami shares an obvious admonition: “When you love, sometimes you lose it all.” It would come across as trite were it not for the way her falsetto warbles across kitschy Billy Joel-style keys, equal parts whimsical and unsettling.\nBut the music doesn’t lean into outsized production or soaring hooks often enough. Many of the songs are caught in no man’s land, lacking both the experimental edge of her earlier work and  the energy and sheen that make great pop music so life-affirming. Dancy cut “Slugger” sounds like a “Welcome to New York” knockoff without ever approaching the1989track’s propulsiveness or winking glamour. Instead, “Slugger” is both belabored and muted, its songwriting mainly comprising a series of arbitrary comparisons. “I’m cry-cry-crying like Dolly from9 to 5” is simply not a strong enough metaphor to be used four times in a song.\nCountry-pop ballad “Just Be Friends” is similarly unfocused, without a detailed memory or narrative to ground it. As she describes the start of a failed relationship, the nondescript lyrics—“Never wanna go home, lying in your bedroom/Always talking on the phone”— are especially dissatisfying given how beautifully Sasami used the same genre to meditate on the impossibility of capturing nature’s beauty on her last album’s closer, “Not A Love Song.”\nThere are plenty of weird, wandering moments onBlood on the Silver Screenthat recall Sasami’s avant-garde roots: her eerie, cascading vocal delivery on “Nothing but a Sad Face On,” the wall of grinding guitars on “The Seed.” These flourishes give the music intrigue, but they don’t always result in an arresting song. Across her last three projects, Sasami has proven she can pull from whatever sonic tradition she pleases to add textured, unexpected elements to her work. ButBlood on the Silver Screenshows that she could benefit from further defining her own cohesive, singular point-of-view. As it stands, her songs feel distant; she sings about heartache, one of life’s most evocative experiences, as if she’s on the end of a game of telephone, recounting someone else’s experiences fourth-hand.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Of course hereminds youofYoung Thug; it’s the dreads, the identical nose ring, and the gold fronts, but it’s also the squawking vocals and flamboyant mannerisms. This is howNine Vicioushas introduced himself to the masses: The next slime-spitting, gender-bending crooner to spring from King Spider’s web. Since he’s infiltrated the algorithm, everyone in the underground has had something to say: thestreamers, therappers, thetastemakersandshitposters. Rap pages are jostling to prove they posted him first. Even more so thanSahBabiiorLil Keeda decade ago, Nine Vicious absorbsBe El Bevideos like a method actor.Barter 6might as well be the Bible. OnStudio Addict, his full-length debut, the Georgia rapper adorns Atlanta’s idiosyncratic template with modern-day luster. It’s an act of artful reverence at its best, a glitzy cosplay showing at its worst.\nBetween the Thugger idolatry, a manicureddigital footprint, andMJ-inspiredcover art, Nine Vicious’ story starts with measured presentation. But it was the lucid glimmer of “Tokyo”—a conduit into “F&N,” the tape’s most exhilarating track—that actually won me over. Floating atop a lush flute sample, strings, and glittery bell trees, Nine Vicious’ Auto-Tuned lilt slices through sensuous mist. The feeling is strangely blissful, like sulking in the gauzy brainfog from a midday nap. But as quickly as peace sets in, the woodwinds are pitched down and the hoarse, warbling refrain of “F&N” slides into the mix. “Prayin’ to God, but I don’t pray to Buddha,” Nine spits as brain-busting bass swallows vibraphone whole. The seamless transition is a nice touch, and it spotlights one of those repetitive hooks performed so effusively you can’t stop blurting it back out. But at its core, the sentiment feels pretty vapid. It’s not like a hook has to have some profound meaning, but “F&N” exemplifies how Nine’s chameleonic delivery masks his lack of wordplay. When the delivery isn’t as spirited, like on “Boom Bap,” lines like, “Came in that bitch with a dick/I got a strap for real” fall flat—especially when they follow a claim like “they ain’t even know I can rap/Yeah I can rap for real.”\nThe record’s sharpest production is often its most subdued. “Slide Aht” offsets a slinky, musingBon Iversamplewith booming 808s before sliding neatly into “Black Truck Talking,” a cloister of fractured vocals and somber saxophone chops. A lyrical throughline would help songs like this cut deeper, especially in tandem with Nine’s icy stretches of wordless melody. The record is full of production that could lend itself to explicit introspection, but instead of vulnerability, Nine clings to clichés about girls and drugs. It’s through mutantlike cadences and his freakish vocal range where his rapping shines. On “Los Angeles,” aSlime Season 2-indebted haven of brass and wispy drums, each flow and inflection is more animated than the last. It’s the purest depiction of Nine's ability to build atmosphere; the crown jewel of the tracklist. When he claims “I do not brag and boast, I already know that I’m next,” I hear shades ofKen Carson’sProject Xthat are more refined than the original.\nConfidence yields the record’s best moments, butStudio Addictoccasionally feels too self-indulgent for its own good. Eager to align himself with the greats (first Thug and Michael, now Kanye), Nine uses one track to interpolate “Power,” and another to try his hand at a different classic single: On “One Beer,” he raps in a pocket that’s miles ahead of a slowed “No More Parties in LA” sample,leavingGhostface Killahto choke on his dust. The tracks that harp on traditional hip-hop to show versatility (“One Beer,” “Boom Bap”) end up proving how much stronger Nine’s melodic sound is. Overall, though, Nine Vicious’ debut is a polished, gratifying exercise in absorbing source material to make something fresh. Nowadays, imitation is king in underground rap. Droves of new artists cling onto a sound they admire—something familiar and digestible—but the best ones mold it into their own innovation with time. For Nine Vicious to turn into a household name, he’ll have to perfect being Nine Vicious first."

    "review_text": "Vast expanses of carved-out marble. Coal heaped high like little black mountains. Towering slabs of concrete groaning as they swivel in unison. These are but a few of the grand, panoramic scenes sweeping across the screen in Brady Corbet’s ambitious third feature,The Brutalist. The period drama follows László Tóth (Adrien Brody), an esteemed Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to America in 1947 after suffering the horrors of Buchenwald concentration camp. While the specifics of his imprisonment are only alluded to, composerDaniel Blumberg’s score seeds the film with agony: Shrieking woodwinds, industrial percussion, and minor keys squirm beneath even the most triumphant melodies. This internal tension mimics Corbet’s extreme shifts in scope—from intimate to colossal—and Tóth’s relentless struggle as he grasps at a phantasmic American dream.\nAfter docking in New York alongside countless displaced Jews, Tóth relocates to Pennsylvania to live and work in his cousin’s furniture shop. His modern designs eventually land him an architectural commission for wealthy industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren (Guy Pearce), initiating a decades-long relationship between Tóth and his patron. But despite Van Buren’s apparent generosity—he boards Tóth and facilitates the arrival of his long-lost wife Erzsébet (Felicity Jones) and niece Zsófia (Raffey Cassidy)—the dashing millionaire harbors deep-seated malice. The dynamic between benefactor and craftsman ascends and plummets over the film, shaping the course of Tóth’s post-war life.\nBlumberg has a great hand inThe Brutalist’s thematic gesturing. His score often counters the immediate connotations of what’s onscreen, creating instant unease. “Erzsébet” is a tender piano piece that accompanies Tóth’s reunion with his wife and niece. But beneath the delicate keys are children shouting, metal screeching, shoes smacking pavement. Strings surge as Tóth meets his family at the train station, only to realize that, unbeknownst to him, Erzsébet has suffered a life-altering injury. “Handjob,” a brief dirge of drones and brass that curdles at the edges, hints at the lingering pain of their separation. The way Corbet contrasts Blumberg’s sweeter piano melodies against seedier scenes—of Tóth strung out on heroin, visiting a brothel, watching porn in a movie theater—suggests that our protagonist’s pleasures are vaporous and fleeting.\nWhile much of Blumberg’s score is foreboding, he kicks up a joyful racket during scenes depicting Tóth at work. In “Chair,” as Tóth crafts furniture from sleek steel tubing and slung fabric (piecesreminiscentof famed brutalist designer Marcel Breuer), Blumberg implements percussion that sounds like bolts threading into metal and synths that whirr like a circular saw. “Construction,” the first piece of music written for the film, was recorded at London’s Cafe Oto, where Blumberg worked with friends Billy Steiger and Tom Wheatley to augment a prepared piano. “We were literally wedging screws, clips, and objects into the piano strings to create percussive sounds to invoke the sounds of construction,” Blumberg toldIndiewire. The piece propels Tóth’s return to the building site after a wretched scene with Van Buren in the marble quarries of Carrara, Italy. The furious pulse of “Construction” follows the most insidious acts in the film, as Tóth once more hurls his anguish into artistic compulsion."

    "review_text": "Nearly 10 minutes pass before you hear a single snare drum onChuckyy’sI Live, I Die, I Live Again. The 19-year-old Chicago emcee rose to street-rap prominence last year on the strength of aLil Durkcosign and his keen appropriation of the diabolical drill beats favored by Philly artists likeSkrillaandOt7Quanny, but his sound was distinct: pared-down choral, Blumhouse-slasher instrumentals that put sharp focus on his deadpan performances. But on the first half of his latest tape, he’s backed by little more than reverb-laden chanting and murky bass pulses, building tension for beat drops that never arrive. At its best,I Live, I Die, I Live Againdrops all semblances of song structure, allowing verses to breathe and Chuckyy’s trains of thought to digress. He knows it’s the anticipation, not the jumpscare itself, that makes a horror flick effective. At a time when bite-sized virality reigns supreme, it’s refreshing to sit through a slow-burning tape that unfolds at its own patient pace.\nI Live’sopening stretch is radically sparse, not just in its complete lack of percussion but also in Chuckyy’s refusal to repeat himself: Cuts like “2-Double-O Dash” and “FREE SMURK OFNG” play out like radio freestyles recorded live from theShadow Realm, Hell’s bells tolling behind surreal images wrenched from his stream of consciousness. On opener “Wemby,” he matter-of-factly chains drill tropes with a sense of strategy, as if he’s priming the pocket for absurd imagery that’s still cooking. The gems that do emerge amid the eerie, wordless background vocals are vivid and eccentric. Twenty-dollar bills bloom in his backpack like seaweed. A basketball metaphor that might otherwise read as trite turns hilarious when Chuckyy remembers that Kevin Durant tanked his parlay.\nKicking off the tape with its most unorthodox song is a bold move, but one that pays off. By annihilating expectations about drops and hooks from the jump, Chuckyy is free to build whatever structures he’d like within the newly cleared space. “Hiccup,” with its pizzicato strings and canned brass, reconfigures a first-wave trap palette into a delicate MIDI symphony. By the time the track arrives onI Liveit feels less like a radical outlier and more like a logical progression from its predecessors, adding a subtle jolt of energy to the Gothic haze.\nAfter filtering out his less adventurous listeners, Chuckyy stacks the B-side ofI Live, I Die, I Livewith a suite of more familiar fare. “Hotseat” opens with a verse from fellow Chicago nativeLUCKI, the tape’s sole guest and one of Chuckyy’s most recognizable influences. Bolstered by a spectral bit ofThree 6 Mafiapastiche (complete with hi-hats, snares, and kicks this time!), the duo sound like they’re duking it out to see who can appear more nonchalant. The elder statesman wins out in the end, flashing his technicality without breaking a sweat: LUCKI’s use of syncopated snares to divide bars into bite-sized units makes dashed-off lines like “take pink 30s like it’s a mint” or “Patek remind me of Dove” feel vivid. Locking in with one of his heroes puts a battery in Chuckyy’s back, and although there’s a skill gap between them, I’m fond of the way he refers to the color-changing effect of Promethazine on his Fanta as “power of the Tristan,” adding some magical realist flair to the image."

    "review_text": "In 1984, members ofCrass—the revolutionary anarcho-punk band and art collective from England—self-published the leafletYou’re Already Deadto hand out at their shows. In it, they touted the merits of creating pure art instead of “consumerist products,” putting in the hard work of direct action, and fighting for a world where punk isn’t derivative, escapist, or boring. “It is our job to reclaim beauty and intelligence, dignity and truth,” the band wrote. “NOW IS THE TIME TO CONSTRUCT OUR OWN REALITY.” That year, Crass were touring behind their albumYes Sir, I Will, from which they stitched one lyric onto a huge black-and-white banner. While the band thrashed around onstage, the words burned into the eyes of the audience: “There is no authority but yourself.”\nTurnstile, by comparison, are a largely apolitical band. Whereas Crass spatlengthy tiradesabout Margaret Thatcher and fought for afeminist future, Turnstile singer Brendan Yates writes vignettes aboutovercomingdejectionand turns nonconfrontational refrains like “I need a little T.L.C.” into hooks. But both bands share a DIY ethos: the belief that communal self-determination is the root of broader change. To watch Turnstile’s evolution over the past 15 years has been to watch them embrace what it means to be yourself.Nonstop Feelingangled it as an enticing alternative in the youth scene, whileTime & Spacefound catharsis in introspective self-growth. Then came 2021’sGlow On, which uncorked how liberating it feels to enter adulthood with self-assurance and understanding, its stadium-worthy riffs courting the masses alongside go-go beats and fluttering synths.\nFour years later, Yates realizes maintaining that mentality is just as difficult as reaching it in the first place. “Running from yourself now/Can’t hear what you’re told,” he admits at the opening ofNever Enough, Turnstile’s new album. The 35-year-old singer is downtrodden, to put it lightly, and nursing a broken heart. Though Yates holds narrative at a distance, opting to focus on emotion, time is constantly slipping through the hourglass: “24 hours ain’t the day it used to be,” “Time is happening devastatingly,” “Days into years holding out.” Yates delivers the anxious words with the gusto of someone granted several extra decades to live. That’s generally how it goes with age: As time speeds up, so does our determination to spend it more authentically.\nTurnstile experiment more freely than ever onNever Enough. They incorporateGlow On’s pop sheen to revitalize a period of ’80s nostalgia when punk bands softened into radio rock. “Light Design” merges now-classic Turnstile rhythms withthe Police’s pedalboards and cool-toned synths. “I Care” goes even further; drummer Daniel Fang finds levity in bulbous drumrolls and gated reverb like Stewart Copeland, and when Yates pushes into a higher register, he passes for an AmericanizedSting. Franz Lyons’ spry bassline and Pat McCrory’s echoing guitar in “Seein’ Stars” could retroactively slot intoZenyatta Mondatta. Most impressive is how comfortable Turnstile sound in this attire."

Lucky forJensen McRae, our output-obsessed digital ecosystem is one in which she thrives. She is not just a creator of incisive acoustic pop, but also acreator: Catch up with her on herpodcast, or herSubstack, or TikTok and “X,” where her occasional brushes with virality have bolstered her young music career.\nThe Los Angeles singer-songwriter has been compulsively tracking the minutiae of her life for much longer than she’s been posting. An avid journaler, she harbors apersonal archivegoing back nearly a decade. And even before that, she understood her role as a scrupulous observer, largely as a means of managing feelings of otherness that stemmed from growing up Black in predominantly white environments. “I started to develop this identity of being a narrator and a collector of details about my life, about other people’s lives,” shetoldtheNew York Timesrecently. Put more bluntly onone songfrom herfirst album: “If I don’t write about it, was it really worth it?”\nMcRae’s sophomore album,I Don’t Know How But They Found Me!, is a valiant bid to make heartbreak “worth it”: She forges her painstaking observations into armor and does battle with cruel exes and her own inner critic. Despite her Zillennial credentials and abundant digital savvy, McRae is engaged in a more timeless tradition—the breakup album—and taking notes from teachers likeTaylor Swiftand the firmament of sensitive, hyper-literate singer-songwriters that preceded her. Her first partnership with Brad Cook, producer du jour for writers of folky melodies and searching lyrics (Waxahatchee,Hurray for the Riff Raff), yields a tight, focused set of songs that bloom in thePink Sugarair of Y2K soft-pop—but sometimes wilt from lyrical oversaturation.\nAny appraisal of McRae’s work inevitably involvesPhoebe Bridgers, a comparison of McRae’s own making. After her COVID-eratweetabout a hypothetical Bridgers song blew up, McRae went ahead andwrote it herself; four years later, that track remains her second-most streamed on Spotify. The elder singer’s influence extends to songs that don’t explicitly mimic her, too. OnI Don’t Know How, it’s in the frail opening bars and haunted, peripatetic imagery of “Savannah”; in the delicate blend of daydreams and nightmares on “Daffodils,” with its taut, wrenching encapsulation of cyclical abuse: “He cleaned my clock, he bought me daffodils.” The songs are simply arranged and sparsely populated; McRae is largely alone with her thoughts, or with men who are disappointing or something more sinister. Sometimes, as many do in the throes of heartbreak, she appeals to God."

    "review_text": "Rebecca Lucy Taylor’sSelf Esteembecame a self-fulfilling prophecy. After spending years as a drummer in British indie-pop bandSlow Club, she gave herself a new stage name to juice her self-confidence. Her sound got bigger, rowdier, weirder. Her lyrics about being disappointed by useless men often undercut their sting with a gut-punch of pathos. She could get away with more or less interpolating “Black Skinhead” into aspitting diatribeabout how women are expected to “always be wet, always be up for it,” or somehow channel the energy of Baz Luhrman’s “Everybody’s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)” into “I Do This All the Time,” a strangely beautiful monologue about friends’ babies making her feel insecure. As a pop culture presence, she channels a particularly British form of camp that spanshun culture,chaotic ’90s kids TV star Mr. Blobby, and refashioningMadonna’s cone bra in tribute tothe domed shopping center of her Sheffield youth. Despite her keen way with a wink, her live shows were ardently sincere and affecting, with Taylor and her backing choir often moving as a single body: a tender, sisterly spectacle.\nTaylor’s riotous second solo album, 2021’sPrioritise Pleasure, was voted the year’s best by many UK outlets and got her upstreamed from an imprint to Polydor. At home she’s not exactly a household name, but she’s competed onCelebrity Bake Offand did a great turn as Sally Bowles in the latest starry revival ofCabaretin the West End. Meanwhile in the U.S., she barely registers even within dedicated music media: When I asked an American critic friend what he thought of “I Do This All the Time,” he replied with just a link to Chris Rock’s “No Sex.” You may now accept our rappers, but our weird broads remain a cultural bridge too far.\nBut Taylor’s limited third album feels likely to constrain her audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Having made her name on galvanizing a sense of sorority through shared insecurities, she leans into taking-up-space-core and glib sentiment onA Complicated Woman. Opener “I Do and I Don’t Care” shows that she really does do this all the time, repeating her breakout song’s monologuing formula as she crests to the question, “If I’m so empowered/Why am I such a coward?” The album’s musical complications are one-third uplifting MOR, one-third edgierTaylor Swift(“Cheers to Me” is brazenly close to “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”), one-third unconvincing sex-club fare with perversely joyless themes. Lyrically it suffers from a case of theLizzos, dialing down the personal specificity that madePrioritise Pleasureso startling in favor of broad-brush heteropessimist homilies. “I am not your mother/I am not your mother/I am not your mum,” Taylor seethes on “Mother,” which sanitizesPlanningtorock’s sleaze. It’s less camp than the fairly unappealing sound of being told off, reducing men to silly little emotional incompetents who have only ever readThe Catcher in the Ryein a way that’s probably quite unhelpful at this point."

    "review_text": "Petrichor—the biochemical term for how the earth smells right after it rains—is a phenomenon of memory as well as rot. The scent depends on the makeup of a place—city asphalt has its own petrichor, different from that of rural woods—and more specifically, the decomposing matter around it. Despite those fetid origins, people consistently rank it among their favorite scents, seeking it out in fragrance and in the field. Perhaps they are drawn to the decay.\n070 Shakecertainly is. Her lyrics plumb the torment of love without flinching; her voice often sounds like it’s bubbling up from the depths.Petrichoris a perfect album title for her; as shetoldVogue, the scent-memory is “a reflection of the music itself.” Those who’ve followed Shake since 2016, when she signed to G.O.O.D. Music, already know this. But millions more listeners learned in 2022, from her feature on British artistRAYE’s monumental single “Escapism.” The track, a bad trip from afterparty to aftermath, clawed its way out of TikTok to the Billboard Hot 100 (both RAYE and Shake’s first entry there) to Song of the Year at the BRIT Awards. The song wouldn’t fully work without Shake’s third verse. She deglamorizes the affair; all the frantic posturing falls away until it’s just her and her defeat.\nOnPetrichor, 070 Shake is well aware that larger stages are forthcoming, and she expands her sound accordingly. As on her past work, much of the album is co-produced by Dave Hamelin (Beyoncé,Leikeli47) and Johan Lenox (Big Sean, No I.D.) But there are changes. Megaproducer Mike Dean is out; pop songwriter Sarah Aarons (Tate McRae,Ravyn Lenae) is in. Shake is a multihyphenate singer-songwriter-rapper, but here she leans toward the former two, replacing most of the rap with ballads and orchestral pomp.\nThese are all expected moves from an artist coming off her first Top 40 hit and probably wanting more, yet it’d be a real stretch to callPetrichora pop album. Her distinctive sound is still here, particularly the parts inherited fromMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy: the proggy distorted arrangements, the vocals processed and blown-out until they’re like sawblades in your face, the enormous anthems that aspire to arena rock. (Shake might aspire to arena rock even more than Ye, judging by how often she reaches for guitar solos and gospel climaxes.) The paranoid rap tracks “Lungs” and “What’s Wrong With Me” are practically G.O.O.D. Music homages."

    "review_text": "Jimi Hendrixdid not want to be onstage at the Hollywood Bowl. A month earlier, in late July 1967, he and arguably England’s hottest new band—The Jimi Hendrix Experience, a riotous power trio formed in London only 10 months earlier—had bailed on their first full American run after opening for the squeaky-clean heartthrobs of the Monkees for eight disastrous dates. Though they were, by many reports, the loudest and most aggressive band on earth—with Noel Redding on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums—they had not been able to compete with the hormonal pleas of American pubescence for the headliners.\nMaybe, though, this silence was worse. Just before releasing their debut album in the States, the Experience had accepted the invitation to warm up the audience at the Bowl for The Mamas & The Papas, the sweet-singing “California Dreamin’” quartet so afraid to offend they’d cropped their first album cover to bowdlerizethe toilet originally left in the frame. The Experience seemed to shock almost everyone into submission, the crowd so quiet Hendrix wondered if anyone was there at all.\n“Right now, we’d like to continue on—drearily—with a song named ‘Foxey Lady,’” he said near the set’s middle, a moment that must have reminded him of trying to win over fans of Englebert Humperdinck’s saccharine numbers during one early European tour. Hendrix forgot the second verse to “The Wind Cries Mary” and barely bothered trying to recover. A bit later, he sighed: “Well, dig: We’ve got two more records to do,thank god.” The trio slashed into “Purple Haze.”\nIt was the Summer of Love, sure, but it was also the Long, Hot Summer, with ubiquitous race riots providing a warped mirror of the overseas escalation in Vietnam. The moment was charged. And so, this lilywhite crowd was having none of the Black man in his butter-yellow pants and bejeweled jacket, even if he was letting them off easy. The Experience had opened with “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” maybe the biggest song in the world at the moment, then covered Howlin’ Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Bob Dylan. They’d omitted the murder ballad that became their first overseas smash, “Hey Joe,” and didn’t come close to the despondent candor of “Manic Depression” or the astral slink of “Third Stone From the Sun.”\nSure, he played the guitar with his teeth and between his legs, but he didn’t set the thing on fire, smash it to bits, or, as best as anyone remembers, even pretend to fuck it. The most aggressive Hendrix got was to tell whoever happened to be listening to put their hand over their heart for “the American and British anthem”—a feedback-flooded assault on “Wild Thing.” Folks had spent their $1.50, however, to sing along to “Monday, Monday” on a Friday night, not to be confronted with a coming revolution. Hendrix was happy to be done with them, too."

    "review_text": "ForAesop Rock, the line between perceptive and paranoid has always been blurry. Fleeting observations can turn his thoughts into a red-string conspiracy board, mapping out complex connections in search of hidden spheres of meaning. OnTobacco’s “Dirt,” for instance, he turns a glance at a yard full of topiary into a psychedelic examination of the human desire to separate from nature by taming it. His keen sense for detail can be a trap: He hears a slight noise outside on “Dog At The Door,” a shifty-eyed highlight from 2020’sSpirit World Field Guide, which raises his hackles, setting his mind loose to imagine all sorts of dangerous and violent scenarios. OnBlack Hole Superette, Aesop still notices the little things, but instead of sending his thoughts into lysergic fractals or bullet-sweating anxiety, they more frequently bring him a sense of calm and wonder.\nDespite his reputation as a writer of impenetrable abstraction andintimidating vocabulary, Aesop structures his albums around fairly digestible concepts.Labor Days, his 2001 breakthrough, scrutinized the tug of war between self-actualization and the necessity of work; 2012’sSkelethonwas a pitch-black analysis of how grief lingers and metastasizes; his last record, 2023’sIntegrated Tech Solutions, probed the systems under which we live and how they assign or strip value from art, community, and human beings themselves. WithBlack Hole Superette, Aesop, now closing in on 50, is primarily concerned with aging. He notices a new perspective: Growing older isn’t allback painorthe lament of past lives; discovering new wrinkles can also refer to your identity.\nAesop catalogs moments of mundanity, turning them over in his hands until they reveal their quiet magic. There’s an almost quizzical delight in his voice when he details the majesty of his vegetable garden during “EWR - Terminal A, Gate 20” or the various characters he runs into while walking his dog on “Movie Night.” The homebody anthem “Costco” is a tour of Aesop’s insular day-to-day, which consists of washing dishes while watchingJeopardy!, dusting weed crumbs from various surfaces, and realizing he should invite people over more often. He sprinkles food in his fish tank and notices a steadily multiplying Bladder Snail, a scenario he explores in hilarious depth a few songs later on “Snail Zero,” where a newly-embraced live-and-let-live mentality overtakes his usual nervous need for order. “Bird School” is one ofBlack Hole Superette’s giddiest tracks, with Aesop explaining the grandeur of watching 12,000 Vaux’s swifts plunge into thechimney of a Portland elementary schoolto roost. So much of Aesop’s past work feels near agoraphobic, taking place within the confines of his mind or the walls of his apartment—but here he is, sitting with hundreds of other Portlanders to observe the astonishing spectacle. He pulls a Diet Coke from his cooler and snacks on kiwi slices, both of which are on offer if you’d care to join him."

    "review_text": "Say it with me now: Gloorp. Didn’t that feel good? Still not sure? Maybe this will clear things up:Gloorp ’Em Up, the second release by Philadelphia electro-percussionist Garrett Burke, is a frothy little dance tape in which every rhythm is recorded by hand. Many of them were played on a MIDI controller known as a DrumKAT 3.5, a digital drum kit with small ear-shaped pads that make it look like Mickey Mouse. Between this, an SPD-SX, and other acoustic instrumentation, Burke whisks together bits and bobs from footwork, gabber, acid, and breakbeat, imbuing their clubby rhythms with a blood-pumping pulse without sacrificing the mechanized momentum of a good DJ set.\nA high school marching band kid with a drumming resume that includes stints withMothersandof Montreal, Burke has spent plenty of time behind the kit. ButGloorp ’Em Upgives him a chance to really shred; he brings the same half-organic/half-electronic MIDI meld of fellow Philly cult actsBody MeatandPalm, only dialed into an even more undiluted strain of slamming polyrhythms and gonzo sound effects. There’s hardly even any melodies or samples taking up space—just one skull-rattling fill after another, a daisy-chained string of mulching beats that’s casual, light, and fun as hell.\nAt a snappy 23 minutes,Gloorp ’Em Updoesn’t waste any time picking up the ball. “Angggry” kicks its footwork-y stride into gear with bouncing bass throbs, a wispy vocal sample weaving its way between the beats like it’s gasping for air. Though a couple other stray voices appear here and there—a vomitous appearance from noise extortionistMorgan Garretton “Gangggsta,” a phased-out spoken-word passage from poet Myene Trimble-Yanu on “Gunk Body”—they’re all similarly abstracted, used more like extra grease to keep Burke’s water slide nice and slippy. His drums speak for themselves; “Glimpse” ping-pongs up and down with bongo beats that scatter and pop like bubbles, while “Pergggus” works itself into a frenzy of tabla-like footwork triplets that keep maniacally switching up the groove, digging in deeper as the track hurtles toward its climax.\nIt’s all very low-key, in that special way an album best heard blasting through beat-up car speakers should be. Burke taps into the same goofy energy ofDelroy EdwardsandBeat Detectivestapes, that wonderfully esoteric zone of DIY lifers committed to club music that once upon a time we used to shrug at and bundle up as “outsider house,” even when the label didn’t totally fit.Gloorp ’Em Upis similarly happy to wiggle through its own world: “Ugggly” makes it halfway through without anything resembling a proper beat, rattling dissonant sounds as if rolling them around inside a big tin can. Then suddenly the floor drops out, a wub-wub-ing bassline starts to seep through the low end, and everything seems to flip upside down. It’s a ridiculous moment—a Gloorp if there ever was one."

Their erratically bright and breaks-heavy albumre:wiredhas the sheen of a hologram and the glimmer of chrome. “Powering down like I’m Sony,” they cry, sunsetting like obsolete hardware. After years of working in the shadows, the Maryland musician’s debut propels us deep into their psyche. It’s a panic room crammed with miseries, victories, betrayals, realizations, and music so dreamy it somehow sounds idyllic.\nre:wiredteleports between glacial ambient and percussive carnage. kuru’s frail yet feverish voice fills the mix like a permafrost vapor. The 19-year-old artist has the anxious intensity of a paranoiac: Across the album, even within a single song, they skitter between abjection and self-assurance, torpid gloom and absurd asides about eating soup. It’s hard to tell where kuru’s real and artistic selves begin and end, whether they actually want to CTRL+ALT+DELETE their life (“If I died I wouldn’t be opposed to it,” goes a line on “misery ost”) or if they’re roleplaying a character in a sci-fi sad-scape. There’s a clear anime and video game imprint on these tracks, from the titles—“misery ost,” “save;File-9”—to the fried doinks, airbrushed alarms, and beeping printers in every beat. (The “wired” in the title could refer to the psycho-horror animeSerial Experiments Lain, which features a global communications system called the Wired.)\nTo the untrained ear,re:wiredmight hit like an amorphous blast of Auto-Tune and “celestial melody” type beats. The stacking of sounds in a similar range makes some tracks cycle like hyperloops, verses gliding into hooks without the tension of resistance. While kuru’s flow is a consistently slick slipstream, their voice isn’t that emotionally versatile—sometimes you can barely tell when they crash from elation to devastation.\nBut often the dissonance between the blue lyrics and the lovely music really works, as if the right sound could spare kuru from distress. “vo://id” cries out with physical and psychic pain—images of ripped skin, a body stretched thin, aching bones—while the beat radiates euphoria and uplift, a real-life RPG potion. Squint your ears and the tonal shifts and rhythmic variations are subtle but hypnotic. “yume” is the most relentless track but still feels plush; kuru bludgeons the mix like a satin mallet, their voice swathed in layers of ad-libs and dizzy glossolalia like aSaya track. “I would rather kill myself than fuck with you,” they roar, a perfect distillation of the album’s emo-aggro duality. “give me a second” might be the straight-up sweetest song, an ambient rap meadow of naked confessions. “I’d be lying if I said I hate everything/What I hate the most is feeling vacant,” they moan."

It seems to come out of nowhere, and leadsQuelle Chris, who executive produced the record, into chuckling himself. There’s something in the room between them—an unheard joke, an ineffable energy—that we aren’t privy to. Suddenly, Mono En Stereo’s Blaxploitation-esque beat is that much more enveloping; we’re all in the Cadillac together, whipping through Anakin’s Richmond or Quelle’s Detroit, pungent smoke settling on the leather interior.\nSnippets of laughter appear throughout(The) Forever Dream: Anakin chortles as his verse on “NOTTOOSHABBY” falls apart, the entire room erupts during a goofy freestyle session on “Dr. Phil (Skit),” andLojii’s verse on “CheckOnMe” features a sample ofJadakiss’ iconic cackle. All these moments could’ve been edited out, but the decision to leave them in makes(The) Forever Dreamthat much more charming. These songs seem to form while we’re listening, as though their creators have invited us to kick it in the studio, emptying cigars, passing bottles, and yes-anding each joke. It’s the warmest, most welcoming record in Anakin's discography, a testament to his and Quelle’s chemistry, and the joy they both feel when making music.\nThough Quelle only produces a couple of tracks, he looms large over the record. He pops up in the margins of songs, appearing to kick a loose verse or provide an off-the-cuff hook. Quelle likes to constantly reinvent himself, reshaping his voice with each album to find new contours. Anakin, on the other hand, is a tireless technician, seeking out and expelling the impurities in his approach, honing each line until it lands like a drum roll. His records sound less like different versions of each other than increasingly refined versions of the same idea: an MC whose every song inches closer to a Platonic ideal.\nLike a shoulder massage, Quelle’s presence softens some of Anakin’s rigidity and gently encourages him to take new risks. For over a decade, Anakin and hisMutant Academycomrades have been issuing stoned, soulful music that sits somewhere between the golden-era revivalism of early aughtsJustus Leagueand the dense trippiness ofBackwoodz Studioz. The largely in-house production on Anakin’s breakout album, 2022’sFrank, introduced the Mutants’ dreamy, loop-based psychedelia to a larger audience, alongside beats from progenitors likeMadlibandEvidence. Here, Quelle brings in producers from his stable of collaborators, includingChris Keys, Child Actor, and August Fanon, all of whom specialize in the woozy, heavy-eyed vibe Anakin tends to gravitate toward.(The) Forever Dreamdoesn’t stray too far from his usual palette, but it expands the scope, positioning Anakin as an auteur of mellifluous, multicolored rap music."

    "review_text": "If a video game allowed you to create a rapper with all the statistics needed to attract mass attention in today’s digital climate, the figure you end up with might look like Philadelphia newcomerSkrilla. Physically, he’s regionless—or, better yet, doesn’t read as belonging to a specific American city. His understated fashion sense (primarily all black) is indicative of present-day Northeastern simplicity, where Nike Tech sweatsuits, Under Armour tracksuits, North Face bubble jackets reign. His long dreads and mouthful of gold slugs could land him below the Mason-Dixon or even in the Bay Area. Musically, his work isn’t technically drill because it doesn’t prioritize violence but, in texture and sound, it evokes palpable darkness. The distribution and use of addictive substances is a recurring theme in his work. And, most crucial to his rise over the past year, Skrilla is adept at engineering a mixture of fascination and revulsion with his visual output; you’ll want to look away out of sheer discomfort while still sneaking a peek because you can’t believe what’s happening.\nThe rapper staunchly represents Kensington—or, as he calls it, ZombieLand—a section of Philly that has long drawn headlines due to what’s often called the biggest open-air drug market in the United States. Like many deindustrialized areas along the Rust Belt, the neighborhood is weathering an opioid crisis; images of folks maimed by faulty injections or inebriated to the point of immobility have become fodder for social media spectacle in a way that, at the very least, feels like barely cloaked exploitation. However genuine his connection to the area and its citizens, this is the foundation of Skrilla’s rap persona. For the past two years, his videos and performances have featured, to varying degrees, people noticeably dealing with addiction. Sometimes they surround him while he’s rapping, many clearly uncomfortable in front of the camera. Sometimes they gleefully dance along to the brooding production. Sometimes, he’s administering Narcan to save someone from an overdose.\nZombie Love Kensington Paradise, Skrilla’s late 2024 project, underlined his affinity for the neighborhood while displaying his vocal flexibility and off-kilter delivery. A new deluxe version, which adds eight new tracks to the existing 19, suggests that, at his best, the Philly native could very well be on the road to rap stardom.Zombie Love’s deluxe starts with the Thankutimmy and Paculiarbeatz-produced “Big Opp,” a convincing opener in which Skrilla makes a compelling case for his skill for knowing how to utilize space. Rather quickly, he goes from listing off a number of potent substances (codeine, horse tranquilizers, oxycodone) to gleefully talking about his taste in fashion before stressing that he has folks around him that’ll handle his dirty work. Delivered in a congested whine, it’s busy but still measured. There’s no hook—most of his songs don’t bother with having one. Instead, Skrilla administers chapter breaks with signature outbursts like “Goooo,” “What the fuuucck?” and “It’s me!”"

    "review_text": "For years,Jefre Cantu-Ledesmahas made music in which little seems to happen, at least through conscious effort. Instead, he simply fills the frame with the ephemeral—wind, sunlight, church bells, wandering spirits—and nudges it every now and then, to keep the elements in play. His earliest solo work, back when he was still playing in San Francisco post-rockersTarentel, channeled guitar feedback into bodies of liquid, silvery and in constant flux. Then, for a while, his guiding hand became more apparent. With 2010’sLove Is a Stream, hints of recognizable forms began emerging from the rose-tinted fog, and by 2015’sA Year With 13 Moons, his Mexican Summer debut, those shapes had sharpened into a kind of dream-pop deja vu: short, breezy pieces for guitar and drum machine evokingFenneszandthe Durutti Column. But eventually, as though he’d come as close to actual song craft as he wished, he began easing back into abstraction. By 2019’s sublimeTracing Back the Radiance, he seemed less like a musician or composer than a landscape artist who, in the manner ofJames Turrell, makes thevicissitudes of the sky itselfhis primary raw materials.\nGift Songsis Cantu-Ledesma’s first major release under his own name sinceTracing Back the Radiance, and it feels like an extension of the 2019 album. There, the artist—credited with just vibraphone and effects—largely disappeared into an ensemble includingMary Lattimoreon harp,Chuck Johnsonon pedal steel, andBing & Ruth’sDavid Mooreon piano. He is an equally elusive presence here, unconcerned with solos or spotlights. “For me, it’s interesting just to try to create the conditions for people to work together and get music kind of rolling and then pull out things that I think are interesting,” he hassaid. “And in the moment, try to sculpt a bit.”\nWorking out of a converted barn in upstate New York, where he’s been based for several years, he recruited a new set of players forGift Songs: Omer Shemesh on piano,Booker Stardrumon drums, and Clarice Jensen on cello. Cantu-Ledesma plays guitar, pump organ, Hammond B3, percussion, and modular synthesizer, but the palette this time is almost entirely acoustic; it would be easy to believe that there was no electricity involved beyond the current required to power the mics and roll the tape. They went into the studio with little idea of what was to come out, Cantu-Ledesma has said, which makes the cohesiveness ofGift Songsthat much more remarkable. Each of the album’s three major parts—the side-long opener “The Milky Sea,” the three-part “Gift Song” suite, and the 10-minute drone piece that blossoms out of the latter—feels fully considered, both as a standalone and a part of the whole. In this way,Gift Songsmight be an exercise in perspective: one idea, or object, viewed from three different angles."

But she had already been composing another orchestral work, one that took notes from a deep well of historical sources: 16th century Italian castrati singers; Czech composer Luboš Fišer; the Gregorian liturgical chant Lux Aeterna. Pimienta uses these inspirations to createLa Belleza: an acoustic, liberatory record of personal homecoming and ancestral communion where rumbling timpani, portentous strings, and rising and falling woodwinds meet in conversation with claves, drums, and celestial dembow.\nMiss Colombiawas Pimienta’s Polaris Prize-winning exploration of how beauty is used as a tool of colonial and anti-Black oppression. In it, she examined themes of homeland and Afro-indigenous identity with production that combined synths with traditional genres like cumbia, bullerengue, and porro. She anchored the album in hyper-specific references: the2015 Miss Colombia incident; the importance ofSexteto TabaláofSan Basilio de Palenque. ButLa Bellezais a more abstract treatise on beauty and personal returns larger in scope. The album’s nine movements, arranged with the help of Canadian composerOwen Pallett, do tell a specific story across a transitory 28 minutes, one that loosely follows the separation and reconciliation of Pimienta with her partner. It is grounded by place—“representando a la Guajira,” she sings of the Guajira peninsula, to whom the Wayuu people are indigenous—but overall, no time anchors it except musical time.\nAfter an arresting overture, Pimienta is joined by the choir she convened, the Coro La Belleza de Barranquilla, who sing on “Ahora”: “Eso mismo buscan ancestros/Es la ceremonia de los restos/Un honor que se le hace los restos/La ceremonia Wayuu.” (“That is what the ancestors look for/It is the ceremony for the remains/An honor that we make to the remains/The Wayuu ceremony.”) Across the album, she repeats “ahora” (“now”) as the music circles around repeated phrases and patterns; she returns to themes of ceremony and her Wayuu ancestors—calling back to a time before colonization created the nations of Colombia, where she was born, or Canada, her current home. In doing so, she corrects a historical pattern in orchestral composition and opera, in which indigenous peoples were largelyrepresented as scene-setting charactersrather than asstewards and composers of their own histories."

Hell, if you’ve ever danced to house music anywhere, for almost any length of time, anywhere in the world, you’ve heard its flamboyant, authoritative glory. It’s a building block of dance music, of Black and gay culture, of modern culture. “It’s not just a groove. House is afeeling,” it goes on. “And when you feel it, you will understand that house music isfreedom.”Simply, then, a commandment drips from his lips like honey: “Feel it, children.”\nThe voice belongs toAaron-Carl, who made unambiguously queer music in a time when such forthrightness wasn’t exactly an asset.

As a kid, he was obsessed withPrince—not only for the way Prince embodied his defiant racial and sexual politics in his sonics, but for the power embedded in the “Produced, arranged, composed, and performed by Prince” banner on many of the records. “I used to watch it spin around the turntable,” Aaron-Carl told theSubmergepodcast. “That was such motivation. I was like, ‘If he can do it, IknowI can do it. Ihaveto do it.’ So, yeah, I got my little stacks of books and my little ink pens.”\nBy the time he was a teenager, he was making tracks with a keyboard, a sampler, and a cassette recorder. He was also sneaking into clubs, first checking out the Top 40 crowds at the Gas Station and then ducking upstairs into Heaven, where DJ Ken Collier was up to something much queerer. “Drag queens kicking all over the place… and nothing you had ever heard on the radio,” he toldSubmerge.One night in 1989, Collier played Jaydee’s epochal “Plastic Dreams.” “It was like two years before it hit mainstream. So when the song came on, the lights went red, and everybody just looked like one big wave of people dancing.” He ran up to Collier, begging for a track ID.\nThat song’s emphatic minimalism informed Aaron-Carl’s first songs. So did the bold, world-building techno of Underground Resistance, whose co-founder Mike Banks took Aaron-Carl under his wing. UR was militantly funky, but a little po-faced. Butch, even, unlike ghettotech, the high-speed and low-brow amalgamation of Miami bass and Detroit techno originally fashioned by DJs includingJeff Millsand the Wizard which, by the early to mid-’90s, had become a calling card for locals like DJ Godfather and DJ Assault. With his keyboard and sampler and four-track, Aaron-Carl found himself straddling these worlds."

    "review_text": "On the night of a snowstorm in Detroit this January, I slid across icy roads like Connor McDavid in a rental car to hit up aHiTechDJ set. Not too many others made it out, but the ghettotech group—MCs and producers Milf Melly, King Milo, and 47 Chops—were behind the boards in their hometown shouting dancefloor commands and flicking knobs like it was one of those storiedDetroit club nights. I wandered the renovated warehouse-turned-venue as partygoers did their own thing: Their homies jitted in front of the decks, a couple gently grinded against a column, an old head two-stepped with a drink in his hand, a double date faced off on the pool table. The trio’s new album,HONEYPAQQ Vol. 1, feels like that: a night spent overhearing dancefloor pleas, lovers’ arguments, and drunk jokes at a basement party where everyone knows each other.\nTrue to the low-stakes turn-up spirit of ghettotech, a fast, hyperlocal genre of dance music born decades ago out of strands of Detroit DJ culture (Jeff Mills,The New Dance Show, countless radio and underground DJs) and imported regional club music (Miami bass eroticism, Chicago house soul), HiTech’s superpower is that they don’t do too much. The guys layer sitcom-plot situations and lusty party commentary over their explosion of ticking hi-hats, booty-poppin’ bass, and cut-up vocals. On “Shadowrealm,” a high-energy techno blur featuringZelooperZ, there’s a date at a Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles that I can only assume is taking place at 4 a.m. after the club. On “Empty Bus Stop,” a girl catches their eye at the function and out come the pitched-down intrusive thoughts: “Do you want some Casamigos?” (reasonable offer), “Or do you want some head?” (coming on strong). They make you itch for a sloppy night of your own.\nGhettotech is a DJ’s and producer’s genre and HiTech’s work reflects that. Similar to other regional dance music genres, like bounce or juke, the drum patterns and synths are often so familiar that the beats are more about the tiny details a DJ might come up with on the fly during a set: the faded laser beams in the euphoric “Spank!,” the “ayyys” in the second half of “Empty Bus Stop” that instantly turn the groove into a dance battle, or the brief few seconds of buffering that interrupt the twerk romance of “Norf Cold 304’s.” That impulsive streak carries over to the guests. Milfie’s casual speak-sing on “Audishawty” sounds like she was just hanging out and happened to lay down some vocals. Rob Apollo drops by “Girl U So Fine” to land the tape’s funniest line: “Busting through that IUD, I’m tryna’ make a miracle.” That feeling of friends partying and making music to make the partying even better is what HiTech is all about."

    "review_text": "Coming home to your parents’ place can make all your teenage habits and memories surge back up. There’s something about the debut album by New York singer-songwriter Maya McGrory, akaColle, that suits this kind of idle reminiscing. Inspired by childhood memories of living somewhere called Montalvo Road, with no other context or geographic trailheads,Montalvounfurls like a half-remembered dream sequence. Shy guitars strum softly like they’re hiding in their bedrooms and synths ripple like chimney smoke. Haunt-rock bandChanel Beads, in which McGrory performs vocals and guitar, is already pensive and dissociative.Montalvodescends to another level of Ambien-pop abstraction, stripping away the jittery instrumentation and chantable refrains.\nIn aninterview, Chanel Beads’ Shane Lavers described how the band is intrigued by the fragility of memory, the way intense feelings often linger longer than specific details. Colle seems to apply that same idea toMontavalo, softening the edges so all that’s left are poignant traces of scenes and sensations you can’t fully grasp. Only Colle’s voice guides us through the haze, singing about devotion and longing with the cosmic freeflow ofGrouperand the airy lift ofSaint Etienne’s Sarah Cracknell. The strings and synths of “Silent But for Joy” sound as blissed as her breathy confessions and wordless trills; everything sways like lilypads on a pond. An aching downtempo beat gives shape to the wistful murk of “Day You Told Me,” a sweet if literal blast to the past—lyrics that return to some important moment long ago, conveyed through woozy trip-hop that conjures up visions of the ’90s.\nThe most hypnotic tunes shed the percussion, leaving just a forest of flickering colors barely lit by Colle’s quivering ember of a voice. It’s halcyawn music, a curious mix of longing and ambivalence with a subtle undercurrent of anguish. “Winter Garden” soothes like a serenade in a private language, Colle’s vocals sounding as honeyed and incoherent as birdsong, until they slowly shape into a pained lament: “Can’t you see I did, I did do anything for you.” Her vocals are so feather-thin it’s easy to miss the first part of the sentence, and to hear only the rippling afterimages as a gentle promise: “Anything for you, anything for you.” These songs feel like double-exposure photos, trapping serenity and unease in the same frame.\nThe diffuse drift may leave you craving more to chew on—narrative signposts, screwed samples, something distinctive to bring Montalvo Road to sharper life. But often the music is pretty enough that the feelings transcend the blurry slurries of barely audible phrases. The main sensation is a potent yet fading warmth, like walking down your childhood street one last time. As Colle swirls into the drowsy goodbye of “Plea and Luck,” she repeats, “It’s so hard to hold onto you.” She could be talking about a strained relationship, but also to a sense of self—her memories, her wounds, the brief time we all have on Earth that keeps slipping by."

    "review_text": "Shortly after the release of his first solo album, 2020’sSerpentine Prison,Matt Berningerfell into a depression so deep that he could neither write nor sing. Having spent two decades detailing smoke-thick melancholy as the lead singer ofThe National, the sudden inability to articulate this all-consuming darkness was debilitating. On The National’s twin 2023 albums,Laugh TrackandFirst Two Pages of Frankenstein, he confronted that year in paralysis head-on. Now, on his second solo album,Get Sunk, he seems determined to leave that bleak period behind him for good. But his more positive outlook comes at the expense of the rich detail and self-analysis that brings Berninger’s work with The National to life.\nFrom the outset, Berninger gestures at epiphanies without exploring them. Opener “Inland Ocean” builds around a tremolo guitar with little flourishes of wind and strings as Berninger sings about something imprecise: “Lost cause, I have no emotions.” A pared-down choir returns to that line as though it’s a mantra, but the lyric is so vague that it comes off less as profundity and more as a stray thought. The same is true on the following track, “No Love,” where Berninger sketches the feeling of a location but never returns to shade in the empty spaces. “This place has a sinking feeling/The energy's so strange,” he sings, “It doesn't have anything to do with anything/The vibes aren't right.” Major chords and uncluttered mixes undercut any uneasiness those lines might have conjured.\nThese songs lack Berninger’s gift for rendering the mundane dramatic. Take “Once Upon a Poolside” fromFirst Two Pages of Frankenstein,the first song he wrote after that debilitating bout of writer’s block. There, too, he’s disoriented—“What was the worried thing you said to me?” he asks in the stark chorus—but he fights through to find some poetry in his senses: the smell of sweet perfume, planes sinking into sidewalks, a panic attack in super slow-motion. All that Berninger evokes at the top ofGet Sunkis the slow-motion.\nThere are moments of intrigue onGet Sunk, not least the two duets. “Breaking Into Acting” features Meg Duffy ofHand Habits, while Julia Laws, a.k.a. Ronboy, adds minimal melodies on “Silver Jeep.” Their voices are a welcome reminder of a world outside Berninger’s mind, and his lyrics open up as a result. In the intriguing little scraps of detail on the latter song—“I gotta get a message to you without signals/AC motor puts me right to sleep/I dream of dreaming and grind my teeth”—Berninger finally attempts to express the inexpressible, rather than simply acknowledging it and letting it go. His sonorous, croaking baritone feels weightier when tied to Laws’ airy harmonies."

    "review_text": "Yolanda Quarteyhas always done it her way. Self-determination has been the English singer-songwriter’s primary subject ever since she made a splash at AmericanaFest back in 2016, and she arrived in Nashville with a gift for turning empowerment into poetry. Following the breezy acoustic folk of 2016’sOrphan Offering, she signed withDan Auerbach’sEasy Eye Sound Recordsand immediately began assembling a small but diverse catalog that ranged from the opulent countrypolitan soul of 2019’sWalk Through Fireto the lush ’70s roller-skate pop of 2021’sStand for Myself.Her songs were never going to get the attention of country radio, of course, but she nevertheless managed to carve out a career in Nashville: touring withChris Stapleton, singing with theHighwomen, and triumphantly headlining the Ryman Auditorium.\nMy Way, her first release since leaving Easy Eye and signing with S-Curve, sounds like a regrouping, shutting the door on one phase of her career while opening another. These five very different songs show her range as a songwriter, singer, and auteur, but they fit together primarily as a souvenir of a session. Yola recorded them out in Los Angeles with producers Sean Douglas and Zach Skelton, who have more experience with artists likeMeghan Trainor,Lizzo, andSelena Gomez. They rehash some ideas from her previous albums and hint at some intriguing paths Yola might take on her next release, butMy Wayplays more like a placeholder than a major statement. Each song stands for itself, some more shakily than others.\nIf there is a common theme, it’s sex.My Wayis a deeply thirsty record. With its strutting rhythm section, “Temporary” could be aStand for Myselfouttake, but at least it shows Yola’s ability to draw rich complexities out of everyday romantic predicaments. She makes resisting temptation sound tempting: A “no” can be as meaningful as anything that comes after a “yes.” On the other hand, “Symphony” proves that errant similes are anything but sexy. Even Yola can’t muster up the charisma to sell the come-on in the chorus: “Play my heart strings with both hands, and I’ll sing like a symphony.”\nPerhaps the best moment onMy Wayis a song that sounds like it’s rooted in Yola’s pre-Nashville career. Before moving to the States, she was active in London’s broken-beat scene, where she collaborated with Bugz in the Attic,as well as groups like Massive AttackandSub Focus. Dance has always motivated her music—she revived her Bugz cover of Yarborough & Peoples’ disco banger “Don’t Stop the Music” at the Ryman—but it comes to the fore on “Future Enemies,” with its percolator beat, distorted chorus, and robot vocal at the end. The setting gives Yola a lot to work with as a singer: She holds back on the verses, adopting a conversational delivery that allows her to daydream about how this tryst might go down: “You’re looking how you’re looking, so it’s even harder to say no to what I want.” She snaps out of it on the chorus, attacking an intricate hook so fearlessly that she sounds like the scolding angel on her own shoulder. It’s a powerful drama in four minutes.\nThat leaves “Ready” as the odd song out, a leftfield experiment that’s exactly the kind of thing that EPs are made for yet doesn’t quite fit the mood or subject matter of the other songs. The idea is compelling: It’s a call to members of the African diaspora to be ready to leave the Western world and return to their common home. But if the other four songs are made for dancefloors, this one is made for the stage, a piece of musical theater perhaps drawn from Yola’s recent experience playing Persephone inHadestown. Even more awkward than its wordy chorus is its placement on the EP. It’s tacked on to the end ofMy Way, almost as an afterthought; it might be more effective as the introduction to a very different set of songs that are more communal than sexual, more public than private. Perhaps on a more confident album, such a sequencing slip-up might not be remarkable, but here, it makes her mighty voice sound strangely tentative."

    "review_text": "The avant-garde Spanish collectiveRusia-IDKhas set the bar for the rest of the scene coming out of Madrid with their genre-blending experimental music. Though all five members are excellent, tight-knit, and supportive of each other’s solo projects, there’s always someone who gets more recognition on the global stage. For Odd Future, it was Tyler, Frank, and Earl. For Spain’s most interesting group, it would be free-wheeling experimentalistRalphie Chooand the more reclusive—but no less compelling—Rusowsky.\nA classically trained pianist with a taste for unhinged beats and sentimental love songs, the 26-year-old producer has been co-architecting the strange, danceable, and thought-provoking soundscape that has put Rusia-IDK on the map. A “kinky Figaro,” if you will. On his debut,DAISY, Rusowsky goes full-throttle, doling out both mournful piano ballads and bouncy mosh-pit tracks with ease.\nLike many producer-fronted albums,DAISYis impeccably curated. Right from the start, “KINKI FÍGARO” taps rising experimental rapper Jean Dawson, who ushers us out of an orchestral intro and into a hard beat that lays out the album’s possibilities and its off-kilter approach.Ravyn Lanae’s cheeky chorus on the angelic “pink + pink” prances around rattling percussion and handclaps before Rusowsky’s voice comes through a flurry of electronic harp. His vocoder-tinged duet withKevin Abstracton “Liar?” keeps a song about feeling lonely with a partner humorous and light.\nThe early 2000s are alive and well onDAISY. Rusowsky channelsTimbaland’s polyrhythms and softens them with pitched-up guitar strums ready for a slow dance on lovelorn “SOPHIA” and “BBY ROMEO,” where Ralphie Choo appears for one of their reliably excellent tag-teams. Andalusian Y2K icons Las Ketchup aresampled to brilliant effecton “Johnny Glamour.” A rumba built around twinkling piano that also interpolates his early Ralphie Choo-assisted single “Dolores,” Rusowsky successfully makes a bridge between generations of Spanish pop.\nThe legendary chorus of Panamanian reggaetonera Lorna’s “Papi Chulo… Te Traigo El Mmmm” serves as the jumping off point of club juggernaut “sukkKK!” Though minor neoperreo divaLa Zowiadds very little with her vapid verses, the song is saved by the sheer fun of its expansive chaos. During its all-too-short two minutes, a fuzzed-out bass ready for a sweaty mosh pit breaks into handclaps, an explosion of electronica, and the top of a ’90s dembow drum machine that quickly turns into Brazilian funk.\nDAISYisn’t tied to any specific narrative, but its name seemingly evokes a key reference. In2001: A Space Odyssey, as the HAL 9000 supercomputer shuts down, the proto-AI sings an 1894 standard called “Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)”. Rusowsky’s “4 Daisy” might be an answer, the original song’s “I’m half crazy all for the love of you” channeled by way of layered guitar and Rusowsky crooning, “If you always looked at me like that/I know I’d die” in Spanish. Really listen to his lyrics: beneath the multitude of effects and the playful sonic laboratory’s explosion is a hand reaching out to be touched. With the robotics of modern production and the freakish and sweet longings of the human heart, Rusowsky has achieved something as expansive and existential as it is technically impressive and touching."

    "review_text": "By day,Erika de Casierdeals out soft-spoken come-ons and kiss-offs via throwback R&B. By night, she’s an incognito hitmaker. Last year de Casier lent a steely edge to Floridian producerNick Léon’s heady summer club cut “Bikini,” and in 2023 she got in the studio with K-pop groupNewJeans, co-writing several songs from theirGet UpEP—among them the winningly naive “Super Shy.” The Danish singer has quietly left her fingerprints all over pop’s ongoing Y2K revival, but sometimes at the cost of Erika de Casier the solo recording artist. While her last album, 2024’sStill, could often stun and delight—the laugh and twinkling chimes that kick off “Lucky” never fail to make me grin—a spate of unnecessary guest features diluted its creator’s singular talents. Entirely self-written, self-produced, and released on her own label, Independent Jeep Music,Lifetimeis a deliberate recentering, de Casier’s attempt to single-handedly distill the better part of a decade into one highly potent vibe.\nForgoing her trademark nostalgia for the ’00s, de Casier has committed herself to pre-Napsterdom in spirit and sound, triangulating three high-concept pop lodestars all released between 1992 and 1998:Janet Jackson’sJanet.,Madonna’sRay of Light, and, at the apex of her altar,Sade’sLove Deluxe. Every song here fades in—how retro isthat—on a bed of aqueous synthesizers, buoyed by boom-bap drums. “If you know, what I’d do, do to you,” de Casier coos on album opener “Miss,” her voice enveloped in so much reverb that it dissolves at the edges. One working title forLifetimewasMidnight Caller, an easy shorthand for seduction, mystery, and menace rolled into one. Several tracks (“You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” “The Chase,” “Two Thieves”) even incorporate what are either diegetic dial tones—a noted Janet-ism—or soundwaves shaped to convincingly mimic one.\nAs “Miss” yields to the hothouse piano and tabla of “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,”Lifetimetakes a turn towardsPure Moods, and with that some period-accurate new-age triteness: “Health or disease—you never know what you get/Might as well live gratefully.” But de Casier delivers these songs archly and suggestively—a glimmer in her eye, liquor on her breath—and the lyric sheet is appropriately marked up with each stray “uh,” “uhmm,” “ah,” and “mmh-mhh.” On “Moan,” a spiritual successor to Jackson’s “Throb,” her hypnotic entreaty to “just make love” warps the whole track around it, as represented by an impassioned keysmash: “%!//&”//“/!!/!(()!=“##=”. The syncopated hook of “Delusional,” built around a sample immortalized byCypress Hill’s “Insane in the Brain,” is irresistibly ear-catching, as is the way de Casier’s tongue catches on “slow mo-tion,” right before “You Got It!” kicks up a spray of seafoam. And once in a while, de Casier will hit on something profound: “The truth was in the bottom of the wine/Bordeaux can make you talk a lot,” she notes, soberly, on the trip-hop standout “December.”"

    "review_text": "Thirty seconds into “In the Wind,” the third song onDear Psilocybin, Detroit rapperZelooperZexperiences a harrowing moment of clarity.Real Bad Man’s unhurried beat wafts around him; an acoustic guitar figure laps against a sunny synth melody, and a filtered noise sweep swirls like a breeze through a leafy canopy. It’s peaceful and luxuriant, but once ZelooperZ raps, “Feel like I’m in a drain in the sink/It’s a downward spiral,” you notice the darkness playing at the song’s edges. Ze’s slurring voice lags behind the beat, stumbling over references to popping beans and nodding out, and suddenly, the music’s tranquility feels threatening, shrinking to a tunnel-vision point. Whenthe Alchemistshows up for an admittedly great verse, it’s unsettling, as if ZelooperZ passed out early at the kickback, but no one really noticed.\nIn a comment on anInstagram postpromoting “Sweet Celine,”Dear Psilocybin’s hair-raising first single, Ze explains to a fan that he made the album just before going sober, describing it as a “stream of psychosis.” For an artist as unpredictable as ZelooperZ to make such an admission is stark; his wild-eyed music often felt like it was coming apart at the seams, each beat barely able to contain his energy. It always took a moment to orient yourself in one of his albums, bracing for the inevitable sharp left turns and gasping for breath when he took them. That naked sense of danger isn’t as immediately apparent onDear Psilocybin, thanks in part to the cohesive soundscapeReal Bad Manprovides, but it lurks beneath the surface, revealing itself a little more with each listen.\nIt’s easy to get lost in the duo’s technical prowess. ZelooperZ and Adam Jay Weissman (the man behind the music arm of L.A. design collective Real Bad Man) are also visual artists, and both pay close attention to textural detail. Ze warps his voice like a broken tape machine, speeding up and slowing down at strange intervals. He understands the impact of a slight change in inflection: On “World Blew,” he suddenly sings the last word of his first four bars, transitioning his voice from deep, torpid monotone to high-pitched anxiety. Despite its catchy melodies, Weissman’s loop-based production initially scans as droning and static, but closer inspection reveals complex chops and layering. He sneaks in small elements that guide big dynamic changes, like the shaker duringMavi’s verse on “Past Life” or the synth sequences at the end of “Sweet Celine,” giving songs a movement you didn’t know was missing. Sinking into the time-bending sounds ofDear Psilocybinis mesmerizing."

    "review_text": "There’s something of a chasm between the respective styles employed byLarry Juneand2 Chainz. On one side of the scale sits June as the everyman iconoclast, whose nonchalant approach—spitting simple flexes and straightforward routines over post-hyphy beats and serene loops—barely gets his heart rate above resting. Staring across from him is 2 Chainz as trap’s resident elder statesman, who’s made his bones in the sub-genre wielding his larger-than-life presence with absurdity and spontaneity. So at first,Life Is Beautiful, a collaboration featuring the duo andthe Alchemist, seems like an improbable logic problem: an album that seeks to enjoin a square peg with a round hole.\nFor years now, the Alchemist has been steadily transitioning away from crafting the bone-shuddering boom-bap beats of his early career and toward furnishing dreamscapes with psychedelic loops and minimal effects. It has cemented the Beverly Hills-raised legend as a go-to producer for indie darlings and mainstream stars alike, weaving brilliant albums withBoldy James,Earl Sweatshirt, andRoc Marciano, tinkering and experimenting to tailor to his collaborators’ idiosyncrasies. ButLife Is Beautiful’sthree-body problem proves to be a tad more difficult. Catering to June’s laid-back temperament, the triumvirate play around in a breezy, luxurious atmosphere (not unlike that of the Alchemist’s sauntering, 2023 EP,Flying High). Yet, the competency can feel a tad underwhelming at times, as though you can feel the meat being left on the bone by the reduced hunger.\nIt mirrors the strategy employed onThe Great Escape, the 2023 link-up between June and the Alchemist. A placid haze settles over the 37-minute runtime ofLife Is Beautiful, turning the production into an easy-listening exercise: You can almost hear the waves lapping in the background of “I Been” as the synths take control, or feel yourself drifting away to the serene vocal sample (which sounds eerily reminiscent of those old Italian movie theme songs) on the opener “Munyon Canyon.” In terms of beat selection, there are sparse callbacks to the Alchemist’s boom-bap tendencies—the mafioso piano loop on “Colossal” rattles around in the listener’s brain, while “Bad Choices” blares with its loud mix and screaming soul interpolation—but much of the production’s best moments hinge on making that drumless minimalism stretch for June and 2 Chainz. Little more than a fluttering flute sample fills the atmosphere on “Life Is Beautiful,” providing a brilliant foil to the pair’s deep tenors as they celebrate their victories."

    "review_text": "When I tell you thatMirar’s debut album showcases a style of metal halfway between djent and dubstep, you’d be forgiven for picturing Monster-sipping coworkers pulling you over to their desk and forcing you to watch their favorite music videos. Then, when I tell you their music could be described as “angelic,” you might actually spit out your coffee. Yet somehow, the instrumental French-Norwegian duo of Léo Watremez and Marius Elfstedt thread the needle between these extreme styles in a way that distills their chromium sheen down to a pure drip. Digitally mulched-up guitars slam into each other to create the impression of a bass drop that never begins or ends; their flayed tones gnaw into each other, constantly revealing little pockets of melody to exploit and destroy, decorated all the while by a shroud of elegiac harpsichord and piano. It’s depraved, yet weirdly tasteful.\nAdherents of a very specific, very nerdy strain of technical metal, Mirar derive inspiration less from the cyclical, polyrhythmic djent ofMeshuggahthan from Vildjharta’s thall sound. It’s a somewhat tongue-in-cheek offshoot that prioritizes stop-start grooves and dissonant high notes to emphasize the music’s disturbing atmosphere. To their credit, Mirar don’t get too wrapped up in the specifics of the metal subgenre wars (“We mostly just listen to classical and jazz,” the duo admitted in a recent interview before going on to sing the praises ofSkrillex). The band formed when Elfstedt found Watremez’s shred videos on YouTube and decided to reach out, sharing an appreciation for the stray sonic artifacts created by using cheaper digital effects on their guitars. Following a strong EP last year that introduced their melodic,at times even mournfultake on djent, their full-length debut offers a surprisingly compelling vision of heavy music’s continual evolution.\nAscensionis paced with the breathless mayhem of a 5 a.m. gabber set, and its lack of vocals allows Mirar to draw all the focus toward their textural trickery: how they bend their guitar strings into mutilated half-hooks, dicing up their rhythms and wringing flecks of distortion against one another to achieve maximum impact. On “Mauvais Œil,” their guitars howl like a mammoth’s moan, careening over the song’s ravey opening assault; after a minute, a ghostly piano reverie emerges before its soft keys get crunched up amid an onslaught of squealing frequencies. “Charnier” is even more atonal, a hurricane of screeching horror that somehow ends in one of the prettiest sections on the album, as Elfstedt and Watremez keep coming up for air to wrench a few clear high notes before plunging back into down-tuned hell."

On their fourth solo record, Brooklyn sound artist and composerOHYUNGoffers a missive from this sort of threshold, an in-between place.You Are Always on My Mindshifts away from the blown-out noise rap and pensive atmospheres of their prior discography and instead embraces sample-heavy pop—synthesizing their kaleidoscopic impulses into a pulsing examination of memory and self-transformation.\nIn their early work as OHYUNG, Lia Ouyang Rusli put hip-hop into a particle collider, landing releases on Deathbomb Arc. Chopped-and-screwed samples perched alongside cascading harps and lyrics that exhumed dysphoria and depression, only for the next track to shift from buoyant trap todream pop. On 2022’simagine naked!, they drew on both this frenetic experimentation and their synth-heavy film and television scores (including Julio Torres’ProblemistaandFantasmas) for an almost two-hour-long ambient release more reminiscent ofWilliam Basinskithan former labelmateJPEGMAFIA. Though its runtime is daunting, Rusli’s compositional fortitude is great enough that the record inspires diligent, thorough listening.\nFrom the first crash of drums onYou Are Always on My Mind’s opening track, Rusli seamlessly integrates their back catalog with a new focus on deconstructed pop hooks and spiraling electronics. Pounding percussion and sample-pack string loops form the backbone of the album, and are especially present on its first song. Gnarled violins and cellos walk a tightrope between beauty and eeriness, fusingGASwithYves Tumor—the latter’s disaffected vocals and genre-agnostic audacity represent a clear sonic precedent. Rusli sets aside track-to-track turbulence, threading sound collage with downtempo rap, art pop, and ambient, creating an exceptional and tenacious work.\nThe record’s midsection is a love letter to fog-filled dancefloors, as Rusli sees long-desired euphoria on friends’ faces and begins to grasp it for themselves. “i swear that i could die rn” drops a reference to a DJ set from Goth Jafar at New York’s Paragon club and pinpoints a moment of clarity amidst sensory overload: “The sharpest sound is something new,” they sing in a grainy murmur, struck by a flash of serenity. On “dancing on the soft knife,” Rusli repeats the track’s title, cloudlike and ghostly, until their voice nearly becomes a sample itself; its production sounds like trip-hopOneohtrix Point Never, all squealing synths and timeless drum loops. Layers of electronics and strings try to break away from the bedrock of percussion, but remain connected through Rusli’s force of will and their intricate, amalgamated arrangements."

Does he think this is funny?Handy is kind of a white rapper, but he’s also kind of likeDaniel Johnston. He’s not afraid tointerpolatetheBeauty and the Beasttheme. Or theTitanictheme. Orloosely reference“Maps” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, exactly likeBeyoncé. Somewhere along the way, this pop outsider and Amherst dishwasher, has become—in his own way—more than just a pop obsessive. He’s become a little bit of a pop star.\nOr at the least, he’s become—as the cliché goes—your favorite artist’s artist. In the past few years, he has opened for King Krule on a leg of a recent US tour. Herecordedan actually perfect song with Boy Harsher and then joined the S&M electronic duo onstage at Los Angeles Primavera.RXK Nephewhad Handy open for him at a show in Brooklyn.GQpublished a flashy,slightly hagiographic profile of Handy,talking about his rise like he was an actually famous person, instead of someone who is known mostly to people who hang out at Baby’s All Right. This kind of rise in status often leads musicians to go all out, to try something new—maybe try somethingexpensive.But on his ninth album,Cooper B. Handy’s Album, Vol. 9,Handy opts to do exactly the same thing he has always done: write really short bizarro pop songs with surreal lyrics that sound like they were recorded inside of an Applebee’s bathroom.\nHandy has often operated under a “first thought, best thought” mindset. It gives his work a really special and imaginative quality, like he’s coloring on paper restaurant tablecloth. (How do you listen to a song like 2018’s “Houdini Blvd” and not want to pop a wheelie on a Razor scooter?) And while digging in his heels on this method could have led him to further sharpen his sound,Cooper B. Handy’s Album, Vol. 9proves the limits of always approaching music in this way. If you write hundreds of songs and never self-edit, if you only prioritize pleasure and having fun, you are inevitably going to write some songs that kind of suck. Unfortunately, many of the songs onCooper B. Handy’s Album, Vol. 9could have been reconsidered or labored over, or otherwise left on the cutting room floor. At 17 songs and just under 30 minutes, it’s his longest album yet. And it feels like it."

    "review_text": "It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Once upon a time, the record that would becomeGwen Stefani’s fifth solo album,Bouquet, was a reggae/ska throwback to her early work withNo Doubt. A few songs from that early iteration of this project came out, including the 2020 single “Let Me Reintroduce Myself,” to which the general public replied, “Nah, we’re good.” Stefanirecalledsharing her lockdown-era material with people and getting no reaction. So she scrapped it and moved on. It wasn’t the first time that she’d recorded a wealth of material that she left on the shelf once the thrust of a project revealed itself—in fact, the same thinghappenedwith her last non-holiday full-length, 2016’sThis Is What the Truth Feels Like.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be like anything, in fact. During a recent, disarmingly honestinterview, Stefani revealed that when she started writing her fifth album, she “just had no sense of who I was.” Well, the brain-wracking and soul-searching finally led Stefani to conclude that who she is, at least as far asBouquetis concerned, is Blake Shelton’s wife. Throughout the album’s 10 songs, Stefani defines herself as a devoted partner in terms so bland that they seem straight out of Stepford. Nearly a decade into her relationship with Shelton, which began during their work together onThe Voice, she’s singing about how “no one understands” them and how “I wish I met you when I was younger.”\nShelton’s mark extends beyond lyrics.According to Stefani, it was her husband’s idea to name the albumBouquet. Scott Hendricks, who has produced Shelton’s albums for more than 15 years, also helmedBouquetand has outfitted Stefani with tasteful arrangements meant to straddle country and adult contemporary pop that instead end up in a flavorless void. This is music to shop to at HomeGoods. With a full band including keyboard player Gordon Mote and guitarist Tom Bukovac, both of whom have played on Shelton albums, Stefani recordedBouquet’s 10 tracks intwo daysand had her album.\nThat’s exactly what it sounds like—something rushed off with meager stylistic range.Bouquethas the dynamism of an old floor fan: Its songs are either fast or slow. Truck-commercial guitars abound, drums do little more than keep time, and any flair is fleeting (a pedal-steel smear here, some slide guitar there) or turned down so low you wonder why they bothered (as with the synths). “Late to Bloom,” for example, is like “Dancing With Myself” by someone who thinks masturbation is a sin. Stefani hasreferredto her musical inspiration here as soft rock andBouquetis notable for never attempting to sound youthful. The album is self-consciously “age-appropriate” in a manner that pop albums from veteran divas rarely are, perhaps its most persuasive sign that Stefani, a lightning bolt onstage, has indeed settled down. We’re left wondering where Stefani put the energy that has defined her musical output for the better part of the past three decades."

    "review_text": "For a long time, much of Thomas Bodén’s music sat in a drawer. Recorded on a handful of synthesizers in the second half of the 1990s, it went unreleased for decades, until Kiran Sande, of theBlackest Ever Blacklabel—home to shadow-dwelling artists likeRaime,Dalhous, andTropic of Canceruntil it shuttered in 2019—convinced Bodén to unleash it. In 2018, the music started trickling out via a series of self-released vinyl LPs sold at Sande’s record store, Low Company. Some of the material was archival, some more recent, and some newly reworked. It all evoked a grim strain of minimalism that once flourished in the crosshatched overlap between ambient and techno. A few hallmarks predominated: smudged charcoal, rain-slicked glass, feeble streetlamps struggling to pierce dense fog. To distinguish this wintry output from the Swedish musician’smanyotherprojects, Bodén chose the alias Civilistjävel!—a word meaning, roughly, “civilian bastard,” which he picked up from the 1969 filmÅdalen 31, about a 1931 sawmill strike that left five people dead. The film was politically charged and, in the United States, X-rated; Civilistjävel!’s music, on the other hand, was almost stone-faced in its mysteriousness.\nGood luck encountering any of those recordings anywhere but YouTube, or trading at a premium on the secondary market. But three years ago, Bodén began putting out new music onFergus Jones’FELT label, easily found on streaming platforms and Bandcamp, launching what might be considered Civilistjävel!’s overground era. The greater availability doesn’t necessarily mean a leap in accessibility: It remains murky, moody stuff, and though the fidelity has sharpened slightly, most of it could still pass for a decades-old dispatch from a dimly lit room.\nFöljd, Civilistjävel!’s latest album, marks a continuation from last year’sBrödföda, the project’s most ambitious album to date: That record’s untitled, Roman-numbered tracks ran from I through XII, and the new one picks up at XIII. But the new record also marks a subtle shift in his music, a retreat back to the shadows.Brödfödawas unusually expansive for a Civilistjävel release, with brighter colors, a gorgeous vocal feature from Lebanese singer Mayssa Jallad, and even, on the 303 and soprano sax-infused “VI,” a wistful fusion of acid and ECM. The largely instrumentalFöljdholds its cards closer to its chest. Most of its tracks sound like they were recorded with only a few instruments; the predominant mood is patiently numinous, calmly haunted—as though Bodén had discovered a ghost in the studio and, rather than running in fear, leaned in to listen to its secrets."

    "review_text": "By the timeStranger Thingsfinally sinks into the Upside Down for good, Joe Keery might be known as “the guy fromDjo.” For all their attempts to strip the magic and unpredictability out of music consumption, Spotify and TikTok algorithms occasionally create rogue waves that thrust dormant deep cuts like “End of the Beginning,” a low-key slice of synth-pop from Djo’s second album,Decide, to streaming numbers measured in billions. It doesn’t even take a great hook; sometimes just one line will do. “When I’m back in Chicago, I feel it” raises some questions, namely, what is it about Chicago and what even isit? Yet the fuzziness of that line hit the viral bliss point.The Cruxproves Keery’s unexpected hit was not just a fluke: Djo’s now highly anticipated third album is filled with vibey prompts, winking self-reference, and nagging melodies, a jukebox stocked with the past 20 years of quirked-up white boys with a little bit of swag. Which feels like the exact opposite of what Keery intended.\nThe Cruxis an album that aspires to reviews sprinkled with words like “wry,” “writerly,” or better yet, “gimlet-eyed.” Combined with Djo’s new lean toward streetwise power-pop and mandatorySteely Daninfluence, they’d also take “L.A. album.” Keery described it as a concept record, “a hotel housing guests who are all, in one way or another, at crossroads in their life.” If that sounds like one of those ensemble cast whodunnits cluttering prestige TV these days, wouldn’t you know, the songs themselves replicate bumper music inNetflix house style: “Have this character announce what they’re doing so that viewers who have this program on in the background can follow along.”\nLead single “Basic Being Basic” is the most glaring example of Keery and co-songwriter Adam Thein’s tendency to mistake mere observation for insight. “I think you’re scared of being basic,” Keery chirps, but what does it mean to be basic? Do the basic realize they’re basic? Have critiques of social media progressed beyond “It’s ’cause you’re always on that damn phone,” or jokes about posting salads on Instagram? Is the “Love It If We Made It”-style monologue at the bridge a sneak diss atthe 1975or Keery cribbing their notes? The verses offer no answers; they’re just here to support a song that considered its work done once it dropped “basic” in the chorus. Or maybe this Obama-core indie pop is a form of 4D chess mastery, meeting the “cheugy-phobes” on their own terms; when Keery falsettos on the chorus, I can taste the molecular cocktails and see the “Beets Don’t Kale My Vibe” tote bags anew."

There’s care and composure in the way that Curren$y constructs his songs, as if he’s armed with the knowledge that there’s no reason to rush. The sublime warmth and understated precision of thePilot Talkseries yielded meditations on the spoils of cars, weed, and money; consider also the smoking-room tunes of 2012’sThe Stoned Immaculate,or the Alchemist’s waves of pounding, psychedelic boom-bap beats on their linkupsCovert CoupandContinuance. Through it all, Spitta’s magnetism has allowed him to exist as a singularity in underground rap circles, a former No Limit soldier and Cash Money veteran who pre-dates the blog era yet has survived (and thrived) well after an expected expiration date.\nNever Catch Usis the 10th collaborative project between the New Orleans rapper and producerHarry Fraud. They’ve enjoyed a particularly fruitful partnership since their initial link-up, 2012’sCigarette Boats.Fraud’s blend of punchy percussion and saccharine samples grants Curren$y the space to muse on the minutiae of his everyday life. Because of the sheer amount of ground that the duo has covered to this point, there’s always the latent chance that they could repeat themselves. ButNever Catch Usavoids those pitfalls: Curren$y and Fraud produce their most enthralling work sinceThe OutRunnersin 2020, seamlessly welding their quirks to form a welcoming environment, bringing a slew of capable collaborators into the fold.\nCurren$y has an acute awareness of his standing as veteran independent rapper: “Now that I’m the OG, they wanna do it how I did/And I don’t get in the way, but I let ’em know that I’m here,” he raps on opener “Drop Zone.” The formula rests in his unhurried, leisurely delivery, almost forcing you to rewind to catch the smallest details. He compares the moment that he sparks up toPopeye eating his spinach(“Checkpoints”) and lazily muses about his Brabus G Wagon disappearing in traffic like a rabbit in a hat (“Airport Industries”). When Spitta kicks off “No Wrinkles” with the line “the Cullinan roof got the sprinkles,” it’s as if you’re posted up in the back of the SUV with him, serenely staring up as weed smoke and the sounds of a classic movie fill the atmosphere. More than usual, it can feel like Curren$y is doing a dramatic reading of a luxury Kelley Blue Book—but the richness of detail, combined with the charm of his voice, makes even the most mundane boast feel exceptional."

    "review_text": "Halfway throughNegotiations, the latest EP fromKilo Kish, the Los Angeles pop experimentalist suddenly sounds like an AI assistant experiencing ego death. “When I came to myself/I was gone/And no one else/Knew but me,” she murmurs during “When I Came to Myself,” a slow-burn highlight from the follow-up to Kish’s consumerism-critiquing 2022 albumAmerican Gurl. Her glitchy delivery adds a menacing glare to the heightened sense of self-awareness that recurs like a pop-up ad throughoutNegotiations. The EP’s chrome-plated pop and electro music balances self-worth with self-sabotage, suggesting you can rewrite bad habits into more productive ways of living like you would update your laptop’s software.\nA correspondingwebsiteforNegotiationsdescribes it as an “exploration of the human body and mind as interconnected machines navigating the complexities of modern life,” including the way a working artist can come to feel like a cog in a machine. Accompanying music videos show Kish in dystopian corporate offices and breakrooms, quietly bristling against the sterile environments (in oneshort clip, she’s put on hold with the music industry itself, transmogrified into a purgatorial, always-busy phoneline). The EP’s cold sound palette, coproduced by Kish and longtime collaborator Ray Brady, conveys this theme; sharp-cornered synths, punchy programmed beats, and vocoder-warped, monotone vocals establish an icy, intentionally distancing effect across the six tracks.\nThe heady concept works alongside Kish’s laconic lyrics, which openly address being at war with your own invasive thoughts. “Frankly, I’m just going through the motions,” she admits on the highlight “Reprogram,” her terse delivery punctuated by stuttering, robotic backing vocals. Then she drops the posture for the chorus, where she tries to suss out the source of her feelings of defeat: “Every time I think I want to do this/Waiting for the second movement,” she sings, voicing a sentiment familiar to anyone who’s endured crushing burnout, “Every time I think I want to try, I don’t want to try.” Opener “Digital Emotional,” meanwhile, turns mechanical wordplay into a delightful, straightforward pop workout. Whizzing synths ratchet up the track’s airy, singsong verses whose lyrics link emotional aloofness to technological distance. The song’s dazzling, heartsick chorus—where Kish’s voice climbs up into a brisk, imploring register—is among the most memorable and emotionally resonant in her catalog.\nNegotiations’ only misstep is “Negotiate,” a collaboration with R&B croonerMiguel. Trading verses in a foggy back-and-forth, the pair sound muted beneath pointillist synth notes and a lumbering beat. The washed-out song briefly drags down the EP’s momentum; Kish achieves a more effective buildup on the kiss-off “DCMU,” another track draped in glistening vocoder effects. Here, Kish takes on a slippery flow over clattering drums to dress down a former lover who messed up so badly she’s now forced to “obsess over the careless nature of the male species.” Each verse builds toward a cyclonic swirl of stomping drums and synths, amped up to a piercingly affecting crescendo. For all the existential concerns lurking within her lyrics, these moments when Kish’s honeyed melodies coalesce with her airtight production effortlessly brightens upNegotiations’ anxious perspective."

    "review_text": "In 2016,James Blackshawannounced a hiatus from music, citing the difficulty of covering his bills with record sales and the “stressful and problematic” nature of taking his show on the road. The British guitaristcraved“more freedom to make the kind of music I want, without the pressure of needing to release records at certain intervals in order to tour.” Despite a career of glowing reviews for his 12-string reveries, Blackshaw was already feeling constricted by a system that would become the norm for artists in the subsequent years of streaming’s dominance over music consumption and production. The fact that he’s returned when that situation has never exerted a crueler grip on underground musicians speaks to the purpose of this music.\nHaving been hailed as a Takoma-school revivalist who branched out into Eastern-influenced styles, drone, chamber work, and even lyrical songwriting that earned him comparisons toJim O’Rourke, Blackshaw quit music to work in the food industry, another unstable existence. In 2022, just as the ground was finally firming beneath his feet, he broke his shoulder and found himself out of work; soon after, his dog, Dexter, died of terminal liver disease. “For months I wondered when—and if—I’d be able to play guitar again,” he wrote onTumblrwhen he announced his intention to return to music in summer 2023. “I wanted so desperately to throw myself back into music, to communicate something or anything at all about this overwhelming sense of loss I was feeling.” He publicly set himself several deadlines then apologized profusely for missing them, citing ill mental and financial health. Then, quietly, in November,Unraveling in Your Handsarrived. “It doesn’t really feel enough in the scheme of things, but I hope it might be some sort of small consolation to anyone who’s ever gotten something from my music,” hewrote.\nWhat is “enough”? Enough music to satisfy the anticipation of a small but fervent following? Enough hope to stay sane in a burning world? Enough resistance to push back against an extractive streaming economy? Blackshaw’s hope not only bears out—Unravelingis the most straightforwardly beautiful and affecting record he has made since 2010’sAll Is Falling—but just in case, he throws his entire body into it: The eponymous 27-minute opener was recorded in a single unedited take, Blackshaw wishing to “push myself to my limits” after his shoulder injury left him wondering if he would ever be able to play again. Whatever “flubs and hesitations” he noticed are imperceptible, or at least part of the deeply human mood of this incredible piece. “Meditative” music is often thought of as something you can zone out to, but the essence of meditation is being alert to the changing weather of an internal landscape. This song is an invitation to that sort of attentiveness. It alternates between a few primary arpeggios, one deep and inquisitive, another faster, skittish and glimmering. Every revision refines and nudges the phrases somewhere new: lyrical, fearful, pirouetting then crouched; adrenalized tangles beget feathery anticipation. Occasional patches of pin-sharp fretboard harmonics feel like the clouds breaking, an injection of breath into all this intense furrowing, only to be replaced by dense, eddying strings that create an absorbing sea of overtones. It would be remarkable even if it wasn’t a single-take recording; that it is, and also played through injury, makes the level of focus and expression feel nothing short of aspirational."

As we crawl closer to—or even surpass—cinema’s fictional predictions each decade, those doomsday themes remain the same.It’snothardtoimaginewhy. But synth-punk mavericksMSPAINTdon’t subscribe to leather-clad assassins or red-pill propaganda as salvation. From its inception in 2019, the Mississippi band has crafted galvanizing, anthemic records about using positivity to push back against the world’s harms. Not to be mistaken for blind optimism or egotism, their earnestness is instead candid and community-oriented.No Separation, their latest EP, ups the stakes of their digitized punk, offering an urgent call-to-arms befitting our own dystopia offscreen.\nNo matter how blown-out the bass or experimental the synths were onPost-American, their 2023 debut album, MSPAINT were bound to become louder and more hardwired on their eventual follow-up. Following three tours of Europe last year alone, a dream that they never imagined happening, the four-piece returned to the sticky air of home—Hattiesburg, Mississippi—both exhausted and energized.No Separationsounds like MSPAINT clawed their way out of the mainframe to get there, hair jolted upright and fingertips singed, fueled by determination. Buffering the band’s sound with metal bristles are producers Julian Cashwan Pratt and Harlan Steed ofShow Me the Body, who accentuate MSPAINT’s flirtations with industrial music. “Wildfire” rattles with Randy Riley’s sliding bass and a thundering beat from Quinn Mackey, their amped-up rhythm section begging to soundtrack aStrange Dayschase scene through a seedy ’90s nightclub. Nick Panella is the star of the EP, though, with synth manipulations that evoke Arabic maqam melodies (“Surveillance”), pixelated chords that turn into cascading fuzz (“Drift”) and retro dream sequences (“Angel”);Cyberpunk 2077developers will retroactively wish they commissioned MSPAINT to score the video game.\nMSPAINT preach the power of community, one they’ve built alongside other bands—likeMilitarie GunandSoul Glo, whose vocalistsbothappearonPost-American—and various outspoken punks they’ve met on tour. This strength helps Deedee, the band’s free-spirited vocalist, express unabashed hope in spite of a world desperate to snuff the quality out, whether yelling about profit margins benefitting evil, our own complicity in broken systems, or the refusal to cede your power as a worker. “If this world is falling apart, why don’t we just fall together?” Deedee proposes; draped with skittering hi-hats and synth effects, the view from up there looks stunning. AcrossNo Separation, Deedee preaches words of revolution that could double as sci-fi movie poster pull-quotes: “We were not born to form in lines,” “It’s not your world. It’s been bought,” “Are you not tired of waiting for nothing to save you?” If MSPAINT rooted their past music in mindfulness, this EP posits that civil disobedience is the foundation of collective enlightenment."

    "review_text": "Florrywas named after a character in Betty Smith’s novelA Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but listening to their fantastically energetic new albumSounds Like…, you wonder if it must also be some kind of arcane verb. Meaning: to jam out with one’s best friends as if the 8:30 p.m. sunlight will never fade. Or: to turn one’s own life into a grand country-rock musical, whose songs are filled with jubilant exclamations and pauses for laughter and applause. The band’s seven members—who first got together in Philly, but are now all over the place—are so in the pocket on their third album that you have to assume that “Florry” is a directive as much as a band name. Like: Let’s florry tonight.\nA lot of that exuberance comes courtesy of bandleader Francie Medosch, who has clearly never met a riff she didn’t want to play or a trope she couldn’t make her own. It wasn’t until I read the lyric sheet ofSounds Like…that I even recognized the malaise and discomfort that sits plainly in her songs; her voice is hearty and beseeching, and it often sounds as if she’s singing through a massive grin, like she can’t quite believe her own band is ripping through these flamboyant barnstormers with such joy and ease. When she exclaims that she’d give a film “five out of five” on opener “First it was a movie, then it was a book” (which was notnotinspired byHolly Hunter inBroadcast News)you want to hoot and holler along with her… until you properly parse the full phrase: “If I wasn’t feeling so empty, baby, I’d give that movie five out of five!”\nThese are the parameters ofSounds Like…: Trying to acknowledge life’s inherent, everlasting shittiness—I’m depressed; Holly Hunter didn’t win an Oscar forBroadcast News—while retaining the positivity that formed the core of 2023’sThe Holey Bible. Medosch finds her silver linings in parking lots and trips to the movies, in a “barbecue on Valentine’s with my best friend Eli” and the realisation that blasting Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time” on repeat might be the only logical response to wondering “why you hate me so much.” Aiding her is a band, and co-production byColin Miller, that triangulates virtuosically crunchy groups likeDr. Dogwith lifelong Dylan standom and the fuck-you sweetness of the early Olympia scene, finding a central point that’s hooky, ramshackle, and boisterous all at once.\nFlorry’s artful looseness is important: Medosch most often sings about ragged feelings, and scenarios with a raw edge. The loping ballad “You Don’t Know,” seemingly addressed to someone suffering through a bout of depression, zeroes in on a tiny vision of the future (“One of these days, you’re gonna be amazed”) while the terse “Sexy” sandwiches intrusive thoughts about a relationship between a simple affirmation: “Baby’s crazy sexy.”\nDespite the open-ended nature of many of her songs, Medosch still sees value in a stitched-up, punch-the-air anthem. “Pretty Eyes Lorraine” follows a simple, well-established rock’n’roll format: The protagonist meets an amazing girl who then shows her the ways of the world. Medosch approaches the idea with a typically laissez-faire attitude—the iconic, howlable hook here is simply “My girl’s got pretty eyes”—but she takes a lesson from her hero Holly Hunter: It’s not about what you’re saying, it’s about how you say it.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "When the lily of the valley starts to bloom, it’s one of the surest signs of the end of the harshness of winter. In Victorian-era floriography, the perennial flower—native across the Northern Hemisphere—symbolized a return to happiness. As the land thaws, a cascade of bell-shaped buds and sweet scents spring forth, a herald of warmer months and better times to come.\nThis feeling of renewal and rebirth was clearly on the mind of Will Kennedy when he was working onLily of the Valley, his new delicate lo-fi indie rock album as22° Halo. Written while grappling with the realities of his wife and collaborator Kate Schneider’s diagnosis with brain cancer, the album looks intensely at the shared grief and anxiety of a period rife with doctor’s visits and uncertainty. Still, making the record, he wroteon Instagramshortly after its release, was a balm when things were at their hardest. “It’s helped me hold onto hope when Kate gets MRI scans every two months to see if her cancer has come back,” he said.\nKennedy writes unsparingly about the heaviness of their circumstances. “Cobwebs,” a brief song toward the album’s end, is its glowing emotional core. In a fragile low range, Kennedy sings imagistically about the weeks following Kate’s diagnosis. He remembers feeling the carbonation of a Diet Coke catch in his throat as he consults with a doctor, awaiting test results. He remembers seeing Kate gently console her mother as she heads toward surgery. Each lyric feels rich and intimate in a way that recallsPhil Elverum’s orEmily SpragueofFlorist’s keen eyes for carefully chosen details. But even as he recalls these difficult memories, he never appears overwhelmed with maudlin emotion. The chorus of “Cobwebs” swells toward insistent percussion and prickly feedback as Kennedy and Schneider sing together about clinging onto the feeling that they’ll make it through: “I’m trying to believe that you’re good.”\nThis bittersweet optimism is the defining character ofLily of the Valley. Even when, as on the gently lilting “Ivy,” he remembers the gravity of what they’re going through together—“For a second or an hour,” he sings. “I’m reminded you might not make it”—he still finds beauty in the world around him. “CVS on a Walk,” sung in a near-whisper over twinkling guitar chimes, captures the intensity of the turmoil and serenity they find amid it. As Kennedy offers assurances that “the hair will grow back,” they take comfort in the pleasure of a walk to the pharmacy—such a journey isn’t without its struggles, but there’s peace in putting one foot in front of the other."

    "review_text": "Over the past five years, North Shields singer-songwriterSam Fenderbecame a partly unlikely, partly inevitable success story. His penchant for giving the indignities of working-class life in the UK an epic scale led the press to dub him the Geordie Springsteen, an appellation he leans into with heartland-motorik drumbeats and howling choruses. At his best, he pulls off songs like the coming-of-age anthem “Seventeen Going Under,” which hadReading Festival crowdssinging along to lines like, “I see my mother/TheDWPsees a number.” He’s big enough now that the British tabloidThe Sunreportedon sessions withColdplaysuperproducer Markus Dravs like any other celebrity gossip. Upon returning from a massive stadium tour, Fender used the time off to make a more grounded album, albeit one helmed by the producer ofMylo Xyloto.\nWhere thetitle trackof Fender’sfirst albumimagined an apocalyptic war,People Watchingdepicts a more realistic slow collapse where everyone struggles to make ends meet. The final product sounds even loftier than its predecessors, with production sized to fit his increased fame. Dravs produces alongsideWar on Drugs’ Adam Granduciel, whose experience revitalizing half-formed memories of Springsteen songs dovetails with Dravs’ stadium-rock pedigree: Every other song features strings, backing vocals from musicians likebandmateBrooke Bentham, and the inevitable saxophone solo. The bright, almost piercing mix elevates faster rockers like “Chin Up” to immense proportions; of the midtempo songs, “Crumbling Empire” is unusually pretty, the shimmering acoustic strums and koto-like synths positively recalling the War on Drugs songs that recallTunnel of Love.\nIn an effort to make everything sound as massive as possible, the team obscures some of Fender’s more pointed moments. On the title track, he returns to his hometown to see his elderly mentor, Annie Orwin, describing austerity conditions in the care home where visits her: “The place was fallin’ to bits/Understaffed and overruled by callous hands.” Those astute lyrics are followed by a roaring chorus where Fender battles a jaunty synth seemingly plopped in fromDire Straits’ “Walk of Life”; maybe it’s a hat-tip toa fellow Geordie musician, but it doesn’t fit with such a gravely serious song. Across the record, Fender’s often lost in the wall of sound even as he shouts at max volume.\nHis other Achilles’ heel is his tendency to write with a birds-eye view detachment that doesn’t play to his strengths: “Everybody here’s got something heavy,” “Somebody’s darling’s on the street tonight.”People Watchingcan be frustratingly literal, as if he’s actually observing passerby without considering their interiority. On “Something Heavy,” he touches on drugs, COVID, and suicide, weakly summing it all up with lines about “whittling away at this bag of rocks.” The lack of focus hampers Fender even when the messages are thought-provoking. There’s a genuinely powerful sentiment at the center of “Little Bit Closer” about finding enlightenment through empathy instead of religious dogma, yet it’s hard to hear past the overstuffed writing (“They break you in like a wild foal/Target the dole queue broken souls/I don’t disagree with everything they do”)."

Since the late 2010s, the New Jersey rapper has revisited a bygone era of East Coast mixtape rap that younger generations are more likely to encounter in aDipset-themed Instagram moodboard than on DatPiff. Perhaps that’s whyPapaholic, Vol. 1slid perfectly into an algorithm already serving me a steady drip of 2000s streetwear “newstalgia”—a marketing trend that seeks to put a fresh twist on nostalgic styles without alienating purists. One such drop, a newly minted Supreme tee featuring a photo of Harlem rapperMax B, appeared on apost by Hidden.NYsoundtracked byPapaholic, Vol. 1highlight “Counter Strike,” where Papo raps over a bouncy chipmunk soul beat like he earned his first Roc-A-Fella chain while wearing a pair ofDinosaur Jr.Dunks.\nThe blurriness of newstalgia, both a point of reference and discovery, makesPapaholic, Vol.1a refreshing take on a brand of hip-hop revivalism previously explored by New Jersey rappers likeRetchand reshaped by contemporaries across the Hudson such as Chelsea’sYL. Arranged like an aughts-era DJ-hosted mixtape,Papaholic, Vol.1pays its respects without aiming for a meticulous recreation in the manner ofJoey Bada$$’s1999. It’s more akin to the work of East Coast experimentalists such asRatking: breaking just enough rules to make old sounds radically new. Your brain might believe it heard nearly all ofPapaholics, Vol.1as a tween cruising to DJ Green Lantern’s radio station inGrand Theft Auto IV—at least untilSubjxct 5breaks any traditionalist expectations by delivering head-knocking beats that could be heard in a From the Block performance today.\nTrap-A-Holics and Evil Empire tags dress up the 24-track tape in Y2K aesthetics, but it’s got none of the awkwardness of Timothée Chalametin True Religion. “Pap need the dollas/I ain’t vote for Trump or Kamala/My bitch wear Celine and the devil wear Prada,” Papo raps gruffly on opener “Beast Mode,” riffing on present-day politics with the same cheeky nihilism found onSouth Parkin 2004. Papo shines when he raps about his love for 2000sLil Waynemixtapes and vintage Helmut Lang pickups over Subjxct 5 beats like “Chopper City” and “Sosua Beach” that spiritually channel aughts hitmakers likeTimbaland,Just Blaze, andSwizz Beatz."

    "review_text": "When Japanese composerHiroshi Yoshimuramade the music onFlora,he was pretty much without peer in the world of ambient music. Album to album and idea to idea, his only competition circa 1987 might have beenSteve Roach, but while that Californian motocross aficionado approached his work with the auteurist fury you’d associate with someone likeBrian Wilson, Yoshimura was happy making music that resembled the sounds of leaves blowing in the wind or animals rustling in the underbrush. Perhaps the boldness with which he approaches his ideas onFlora,in contrast to the clean lines and simple strokes that define his earlier work, explains why he never released these pieces; they were only posthumously compiled in 2006, three years after his passing. Yoshimura was a working musician keenly attuned to music’s utilitarian aspects; his 1986 masterpieceSurroundwas originally intended as a soundtrack to a series of prefab homes. But it’s hard to imagineFloraas functional music: These pieces bloom and sprawl in every direction, planting roots in the ear instead of simply accentuating the space in which they’re being played.\nFlorais being reissued by Temporal Drift, which put out a vinyl edition ofSurroundin 2023 and framesFloraas the “chronological and stylistic follow-up” to that album. Yoshimura might bristle at the idea that his work could slot into such a tidy narrative, butFloraalso challenges the image of the Japanese composer as a pragmatic freelancer.Florais the most album-like of his releases, in the sense of taking the listener on a journey rather than existing in space likeSurroundor the runway soundtrackPier & Loft.There are bits where the music fades into a rosy blur in the corners of the subconscious, as when the druidic nighttime music of “Asagao” smears into the brief piano étude “Ojigisou,” but more often it pokes at the ear like a mischievous sprite. “Over the Clover” opens with a leap-frog synth melody as playful as anything Yoshimura composed, but when a loudly mixed saloon piano plays a spectacularly ungraceful grace note, you know you’re in for a messier listen than you usually get from this most meticulous musician.\nThe album’s 11 tracks feel like a set of gardens opening onto more gardens. The songs aren’t exceptionally long by Yoshimura’s standards, typically five or six minutes, but rather than thrumming in the air, like the immovable pieces on his debutMusic for Nine Post Cards,they unfurl. Every time “Over the Clover” threatens to get lost in its own thickets, it finds its way back to its introductory riff, a simple and sublime melody in league with his much-loved standout “Blink.” The title track is built on cottony electric piano puffs so delicate they would seem to blow away in the wind and scatter pell-mell, yet they stay strong throughout a six-minute epic. “Maple Syrup Factory” is beyond delightful, a sojourn to the American wilderness painted in festive synthetic pianos and sour angel choirs. Best of all is “Adelaide,” which starts as a simple and true synth piece similar to Roach’s “Structures from Silence” orAphex Twin’s “#3” and then gradually gets dirtier: a brookish trickle here, a droplet there, until its almost unnatural perfection is replaced by something more lifelike."

    "review_text": "The Weekndis not a subtle experience. He sings hits about erotic asphyxiation and doing face-numbing amounts of drugs; hesmothershis face in bandages until you can only see his eyes. He played a caricature of himself inUncut Gemsand for years after he clung onto “The Character,” as Abel Tesfaye called it,speaking in third personfor interviews. And so it did not come as a shock when he rolled outHurry Up Tomorrow,the album he’s claimed is his last, withbillboardsthat announced THE END IS NEAR and interviews about how he wants to “kill” his pop-star persona.\nHe makes that death thuddingly literal on his sixth record, detailing the twitch of his toes as he drowns in the bath, underscoring his pledge to overdose with sound effects of sloshing liquids and rattling pills. Seconds into the album, he starts taking stock of his legacy, before the track springs into the sound of “Thriller” rising from the grave. The true horror in any Weeknd song is the sense that something nefarious is happening just out of frame: the pill pushed into a palm, the moan behind a locked door, the threat ofrunning out of time.ButHurry Up Tomorrowleaves no mystery or suspense. We know the stakes from the start: These are his last lines.\nThe result is an opulent, elegant, and occasionally exasperating farewell. This is the Weeknd’s most expansive-sounding album that’s also narrowly focused. Even as he swerves from Brazilian funk to rapturous ballads to incandescent synth-pop, he keeps returning to one night from 2022, when helost his voice mid-songduring a Los Angeles concert and had to cancel the show. You cannot get more than a few songs through this 22-track album without the Weeknd tugging you back to that night, in clunky asides about his voice cracking, in a skit in which he shouts, “I CAN’T FUCKING SING,” in lines about his “failing” voice.\nMaybe the Weeknd is weeping because there are no more worlds left to conquer. He whines about how fame is a disease. He scolds a “chronically online” love interest for picking a fight on the opening night of his tour. But then there’s the euphoric blitz of synths that bursts through “Open Hearts,” the shimmering chorus in “Give Me Mercy,” the golden-lit “Niagara Falls,” the thudding chords from electronic music pioneerGiorgio Moroderon “Big Sleep.” There are sublime stretches—unhurried, undulating verses, plush synths, precise images—punctuated by the occasional groaner as he grounds us back in his own misery. All this grandeur turns out to be in the service of something comparatively small: Touring is hard. The Weeknd is tired."

    "review_text": "To be chosen by the muses is not always a blessing. Inspiration can arrive as an iridescent butterfly or a rushing torrent, or, as in the music ofCameron Winter, it can look and sound a lot like torture. “Songs are a hundred ugly babies/I can’t feed,” the frontman of Brooklyn’sGeeselaments near the midpoint of his debut solo album,Heavy Metal. As Winter slips into a falsetto on the word “babies,” there’s a stab of pain—one of many on the record, in which he takes a drill bit to the twin struggles of music and love, boring down to their raw, nervy centers. Bolstered by timeless arrangements that are by turns folksy, soulful, and neo-classical, Winter establishes himself as a songwriter par excellence. But he is also a reluctant one, a warrior-poet Achilles broken down, “beat with ukuleles,” exhorted to take up his pen and aegis by forces far greater than himself. The result is a project of catharsis that never comes across like an exercise in vanity, an outpouring of material as necessary to its creator as it is compelling to experience.\nOne of the first things to notice aboutHeavy Metal, and perhaps its defining feature, is Winter’s voice. Put largely in service of Zeppelin-esque theatrics on Geese’s 2023 record3D Country, it becomes a more versatile and tender instrument here, immediately remarkable for its sheer range and depth of tone. Over the even-keeled strut of “Nausicäa (Love Will Be Revealed),” Winter alternately croons and yelps the name of the titular Greek princess, infusing each syllable with want. And at the climax of “Drinking Age,” a wrenchingly gorgeous piano and woodwind ballad, it practically sounds like he’s melting: “From now on, this is who I’m gonna be/This way/A piece of meat.” That song has Winter breaking out his signature batty lip burble—think when a baby sticks out their lips like a fish and runs their finger over them—as though he’s regressing to a truer, more infantile state. Or it could just be the air leaving his lungs as he sinks to the bottom of the bottle. Pitched somewhere betweenConor OberstandRufus Wainwright, Winter’s delivery is not “emo” but is especially emotive, charged with a need to communicate even in the moments where words and language fail.\nAs the words fall out of his mouth in an aphasic flood, it’s hard to picture Winter actually committingHeavy Metal’s lyrics to paper, though they look too precise on the page to have emerged any other way. With enough listens, the spray begins to cohere around certain motifs—horses, water, feet, enough “baby”s and “mama”s to makeRobert Plantblush—and, especially, names. There’s the aforementioned Nausicäa, and on opening “The Rolling Stones,” two parallel martyr figures in John Hinckley Jr. (“with a candy gun towards the president’s ass”) and lateStonesguitarist Brian Jones, a member of the infamous “27 club” (Winter himself is only 22). And then there is Nina. The only character without a corresponding encyclopedia entry, she’s the explicit addressee of two songs—the endlessly escalating ”Nina + Field of Cops” and “$0,” the record’s only single—and so uniquely, thoroughly rendered as to instantly join the pantheon of classic rock’s mononymic women, right alongside Peg, Layla, and Angie."

Despite the memories of sunset kisses along the Seine and their breath on your neck in a dark London club, there is nothing to salvage. A last attempt. Another dial tone. You get a clue and, with time, self-respect. You hang up, embrace the silence.C’est fini, mon amour.\nThe romantic preoccupations of Japanese vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Noriko Sekiguchi—known by the stylized mononym nOrikO—transcend language. She’s in the proud history of voices that break through the rave fog, carrying thela-da-dee, la-dee-dasand thesweet dreams of rhythm and dancing. In her songs asPOiSON GiRL FRiEND, she recounts love’s highs and lows with simple honesty. Her mischievous sing-song mourns and reminesces in English, French, and Japanese over layered blends of 1980s-style club beats and synthetic strings with the melancholic sensibility of trip-hop. The music blooms to fill the space left in love’s absence.\nBorn in Yokohama, Japan as the daughter of an international banker, nOrikO spent part of her childhood in Rio de Janeiro. She received primary education in French schools, coming home to a mother with a penchant for chanson. Returning to Japan as a teenager in the ’80s, she took advantage of lax ID requirements to attend legendary Japanese rock DJ Kensho Onuki’sLondon Nite parties, dancing the night away to ska, soul, andthe Beatles.\nAfter securing a contract with Polydor to make a singer-songwriter record, nOrikO embarked on a long trip through Europe. She dove headfirst into London nightlife, rubbing elbows with the New Romantics and the goths, entranced by clubs where a single night hostedwide-ranging sounds: new wave, indie rock, house, techno. One night on a dancefloor in Soho, the DJ played an ambient piano mix of Lil Louis’ acid house classic “French Kiss,” and somewhere in the transcendence of the slowed-down beat and the sampled moan and the bass’ seemingly infinite drone, the Japanese girl who’d arrived in the UK enamored bythe Smithsandthe Curedecided to focus her energies on the drum machine.\nBack in Japan, she made friends at a new wave night called “Club Psychics,” according to one of her few interviews in English, with the blogFond/Sound. nOrikO and two friends formed POiSON GiRL FRiENDS, taking the name from Scottish art rockerMomus’ second album, 1987’sThe Poison Boyfriend. The trio released one self-titled EP, featuring a jangly early version of “Hardly Ever Smile (without you).” The more popular recording of the song opensMelting Moment, reimagined with a chugging drum machine, a low swell of synths, and cinematic strings that stand in somber contrast to the earlier “alternative guitar version.” It is now inarguably nOrikO’ssignature song. Her subdued delivery strikes a nerve with the directness of its yearning, whispered over an icy trip-hop beat: “I’d give up all my life for just your kiss.”"

    "review_text": "Whenever I hear a rapper throwing out nostalgic band names likeBlink-182and Bring Me the Horizon, I immediately start to think I’m in for somePink Tapebullshit. That’s not the case withTony Bontana, a UK jack-of-all-trades with the freewheeling spirit of a streetballer out on the playground. Back when he was a kid in Birmingham, those aforementioned bands (and the clobbering unitEnter Shikari) influenced him to pick up the guitar. Like lots of young artists, he started to learn how to play songs he liked, even as his taste bent harder and further underground. For the past four or five years he’s been applying that just-try-shit ethos to the music he uploads online, whether it beSome Rap Songs-inspiredsoul-searching, sample-heavybeat tapes, or his post-hardcore outfitSpew. Not all the genre-hopping works—his fuzzy indie rockexperimentsfall kind of flat—but the stuff that does hit is like finally discovering that perfect pair of jeans.\nTUMPIT,which is 12 tracks of head-in-the-clouds raps and washed-out Michael Jaguar instrumentals, does hit. (The best version of the album, available onSoundCloudorBandcamp, runs two songs longer than the Spotify edition.) It’s a mellow mixtape with plenty of imagination, but it also has too much going on to slip into background music. Tony’s deadpan flows, which fall somewhere between the monotone flexing ofRealYungPhiland the stoned wandering ofMIKE’sBy the Water, lull you in at the leisurely pace of a cricket match. The effect is less wordy and emotional than last year’sL’Humanité, a tribute to his mother, but the lines stick, and sound like they mean everything to him: “If you fuck wit’ me then you know I’ma ride for ya’/I’ma fall in love shawty, I’ma die for ya’,” he raps on “I’ma fall in love,” like he’s so nuts about someone it’s all he can concentrate on. On “Don’t Tempt Me,” the slow and misty beat sounds like a lullaby in reverse, and he accelerates his delivery except for a few repeated lyrics about the days when he had money struggles. After a while, it’s easy to start attaching your own memories to his reflections.\nTUMPITis subtler than the straightforward experiments on his SoundCloud page—rapping over emoguitar riffs, orpunk songs—but that forces Tony and Michael Jaguar to fool around in the cracks and crevices. Here’s “A Sky That Turned Blue,” a random slow-mo jungle track tacked on at the end. There’s “My First Time,” a lovelorn ballad where Tony globs on the Auto-Tune like “Minnesota”-eraYachty. He picks up a cool new flow on “Ice Tea Boys,” channelingRX Papiwith a cold. Only the extended edition has “Eyez on Me,” where a distorted, mechanical outro sounds like one of those explosive nu-metal wrestler theme songs from the early 2000s. Sometimes a song starts out forgettable and then a left-field tweak brings it to life, like the warm sax that kicks in on the otherwise glacial “In Peace” (the other extended-edition track)."

    "review_text": "In the early ’90s, the epicenter of Memphis hip-hop was a nondescript brick building at the corner of Larkin and Cleveland Streets. Its awning had the cluttered look of a word-of-mouth business that didn’t need much advertising push. The peeling, Zenith logo-referencing “Z” of “Mr. Z Sound Express” was flanked by three bullet points: auto stereo, auto alarm, window tint. Saeed Zarshenas, aka Mr. Z, had emigrated to Memphis from Shiraz, Iran, in 1977 with a plan to study business at an American school and return home. But in November 1979, after Iranian students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and took 53 hostages, tensions flared between the two countries. Zarshenas found himself stranded in the U.S.\nHe jumped from menial job to menial job in the early ’80s, but, noticing a burgeoning public interest in beefed-up car stereos, started hawking aftermarket equipment on the side. In a few years, that side hustle turned into a steady living, and he opened a storefront in the Crosstown neighborhood. The crack epidemic hit Memphis hard, and by 1988, Zarshenas noticed a strange but serious uptick in business. “People were selling a lot of drugs, and they didn’t know what to do with their money,” he said in aninterviewwith journalist Torii MacAdams for Vinyl Me Please. “They couldn’t spend it to buy a house, couldn’t put it in the bank, so they’d go buy a car for $300, $400 and bring it here, put a $1,000, $1,500, $2,000 system in each car.” Zarshenas figured these folks needed something to test their new stereos’ power, so he began selling mixtapes from local DJs Soni D and Spanish Fly.\nSome tapes doubled as advertisements for Mr. Z Sound Express—DJ Spanish Fly cut “Going to Mr. Z’s,” a booming endorsement of Zarshenas’ services—but soon the stereo shop became a commercial nexus in an exploding, albeit insular, hip-hop scene. In the early ’90s, mainstream rap was a mostly coastal affair, and its biggest stars—the Notorious B.I.G.,Wu-Tang Clan,Tupac, andDr. Dre—came out of New York City or Los Angeles. There was little consideration for anywhere in between. Tommy Wright III, one of the architects of the ’90s Memphis sound,said as muchto Complex: “I came up at a time when you pretty much thought you’d never get played in New York.” There were rumblings in certain pockets of the Deep South, though; Memphis powerhouses8Ball and MJG, sensing Houston’s potential, decamped in 1992 to work with Suave House on their breakthrough, 1993’sComin’ Out Hard. But most Memphis artists understood that whatever they built wasn’t likely to turn heads nationally. As scene legend DJ ZirktoldAtlanta radio journalist Brian “B High” Hightower, when he was coming up, “The only thing you heard was local…We didn’t rock to everyone else’s music.”"

    "review_text": "Is the dancefloor a place of refuge? Of abandon? Of liberation? Or perhaps a place of obliteration? It’s complicated. In the four decades that he’s been clubbing, Chicago’s Jamal Moss has likely seen it all. He cut his teeth sweating it out at the Music Box to Ron Hardy, a pioneering house DJ known for the intensity and audacity of his mixing. He lived through the Reagan era, the “war on drugs,” the AIDS crisis. Poverty was rife and times were tough, but inside the club, it didn’t matter: “We were just there to be free of that shit,” Mosssays. Over the years, the world that Hardy and his acolytes helped create, the alternate realities they helped foment, went global. The music spread, morphed, put down new roots. The formerly underground became commonplace. House music had always aspired to universalism; now, at last, the whole damn universe embraced house music. You’d think it might be cause for celebration. And yet inside the club, Mosssays, “40 years later, it’s drastically different—everybody’s angry!”\nTo Moss, the DJ and producer best known asHieroglyphic Being, there’s a paradox at work. Anti-harassment campaigns, no-camera policies, Narcan-toting DJs, seasoned bouncers to sift out the troublemakers and rubberneckers—all these measures are meant to ensure patrons’ safety and preserve the vibe. And yet, Moss says, “look around and a good percent of people in the club are not happy.”Dance Music 4 Bad Peopleis Moss’ vexed response to the peevish mood.\nHis first album for Oslo’s Smalltown Supersound, it’s approximately Moss’ umpteenth record, once you factor in releases from aliases like I.B.M. (Insane Black Man), the Sun God, and Members Only, his seemingly limitless series of bootleg edits, and it’s entirely true to form: a surging maelstrom of machine music, synths swollen and drums bleeding into the red, ready to go off the rails at any moment. A nostalgic return to happier times this ain’t; more like an indictment of the current malaise via a defense of the dancefloor at both its holiest and most profane.\nPolemics can only go so far in instrumental dance music; divorced from the context of Moss’ statements, you might never guess that this is an album about discontent. But then again, maybe you would. It’s surly, anxious, turbulent stuff, with unruliness coded right into its DNA. “U R Not Dying U R Just Waking Up” airdrops us into battle, as a stern, thudding kick drum and martial hi-hats carve out a clearing for a fierce rhythmic and textural workout. The chords are soothingly emotive, the drums hot to the touch. One-bar loops pile up, a relentless juggernaut of ideas that peaks with a rascally, pitch-bent synth solo before fading out in mid-beat, anticlimactic to the core."

    "review_text": "The meaning of the term “mixtape” has shifted over time: As cassettes gave way to CDs and later zip files, it evolved from a format to an ethos. In the streaming era, mixtapes have come to signal heritage. This year,Future,Chief KeefandMike WiLL Made-It, andCharli XCX, among others, have used mixtape aesthetics (or the word itself) to highlight their ties to bygone sounds, scenes, and identities. For them, “mixtape” signals not just scrappier, looser songwriting, but lineage and context—the word an umbilical connection to the influences that nourished their style.Denzel Curryis in that headspace onKING OF THE MISCHIEVOUS SOUTH, a playful romp through Southern rap history that doubles as a personal victory lap.\nThe new record is essentially an expanded edition of asimilarly titled album Curry released this summer, a sequel to his early projectKING OF THE MISCHIEVOUS SOUTH Vol. 1 Underground Tape 1996. That 2012 mixtape, recorded when Curry was a teenaged member of gothic rap collective Raider Klan, was also a work of geographic homage: Shrouded in the Raiders’ signature mix of eldritch Memphis horrorcore, slurry Houston screw, and raunchy Miami bass, Curry spent most of the tape pantomiming and often naming his influences. His style is far more self-possessed and versatile now, refinements that guide the rapper’s tour of the old and new South. The low-stakes outing offers the thrills of a video-game speedrun, familiarity accenting Curry’s virtuosic turns.\nLike Curry’sZUU, an intimate ode to generations of Miami rap that was primarily produced by two Australians,KOTMSisn’t overly concerned with fidelity. On the mic and behind the boards, various non-Southerners, from Harlem’sA$AP Fergto Seattle’s ex-Raider Klansman Key Nyata to Milwaukee’s Bizness Boi, make appearances alongside artists from Texas, Georgia, and Tennessee. While the vocalists generally share some kind of spiritual or stylistic connection to trunk music, Raider phonk, or South Florida, the loose definition of the South lets Curry avoid the devotional revivalism of aBig K.R.I.T.orSpillage Villagerecord. (Curry has even bypassed the cliche of havingBig Rubehost the record, instead tapping Memphis vet Kingpin Skinny Pimp.) The mischievous South is more a sensibility than a bloodline.\nBounce is the lingua franca, and Curry proves to be the most fluent of everyone assembled. He struts across the drums on “Black Flag Freestyle,” slinks between the hi-hats and snare strikes on “Act a Damn Fool,” and bobs through the misty melodies of “Got Me Geeked.” No one phones it in, but onlySki Mask the Slump GodandKenny Masonmatch his casual liquidity. He’s become a maestro of cadence and dynamics, often pulling off multiple flows within a single verse while maintaining his street-meets-geek wordplay and social consciousness. “Feel like JFK/I’m tryna keep my head on straight, but niggas dying every day,” he says on “Set It,” swinging from whispers to shouts."

    "review_text": "Dance music fans stirring the tea leaves for signs of a minimal-house revival might have been heartened byChosta-del-sol, a 2022 EP from British producerJorg Kuning. The record called back to the Y2K-era style in both its blippy tones and lithe, slinky grooves; the title track felt like a deliberate invocation ofIsolée’s 1998 hit “Beau Mot Plage,” mimicking its tightly wound movements, detuned streaks of melody, and even punningly beachy title. Kuning, based in the rural market town of Welshpool, Wales, has been turning out baubly, idiosyncratic dance music since 2019, much of it on his ownBakk Heialabel, filtering the ping and squelch of classic minimal into a contemporary sound that’s his alone. His new mini-LPElvers Pass—his second for London’s Wisdom Teeth, the leftfield dance label that releasedChostsa-del-sol—gathers some of his most intricate and inventive music yet.\nKuning’s music has long been immediately recognizable for its vivid colors and crisp lines, and he dials up the definition onElvers Pass. The first sound we hear is the rich, resonant thunk of a log drum tapping out a playful bassline; in contrast to that reassuringly corporeal low end, a welter of trebly details—plinky electric keys, gaseous squiggles, silvery ribbons of pitched-up voice—make opening track “Mercedes” feel like a slow-motion video of a confetti cannon erupting.\nThe record’s palette drips with humor. Kuning’s modular patches chirp and whistle with giddy abandon, resembling squeak toys, whoopie cushions, quacking ducks. His madcap doots and blorps, which could well have been rippedstraight from the pages ofMadmagazine, often feel like the inverse of onomatopoeia: nameless sounds that aspire to the quality of language. The cartoonishness is right there in titles like “Squidward’s Viola” and “Synthetic Squashies”; every corner of the music is populated by hyperkinetic objects and characters. “Teen Frogue,” set against a backdrop of shimmery FM chimes and robotic vowel sounds, is a case in point: First comes a jaunty mallet melody reminiscent ofRyuichi Sakamoto’s “Riot in Lagos”; it cedes the way to a bumptious synth riff, pecking at the ground like a drunken bird; finally, a theremin-like lead takes the spotlight, vibrating with comically exaggerated tremolo. It feels like a runway procession for radio-controlled gizmos run amok.\nElvers Pass’s beats are rooted in the wiggly syncopations of labels like Perlon and artists likeAkufen, Zip, andBaby Ford, but they differ from classic minimal in their elasticity. Four-on-the-floor kicks drive “Skudde” and “Squidward’s Viola,” but for the most part these grooves eschew such rigid timekeeping, drawing instead from the hiccup of electro and the fidgety bursts of IDM. Kuning is continually tightening and loosening screws, searching for ways to fine-tune the groove. Every eight or 16 bars, there’s a subtle shift in energy levels, often thanks to nothing more dramatic than a new hi-hat or a subtle filter tweak. And his arrangements are more elaborate than those of classic minimal, which was often content to shuffle along with little variation, lost in the hypnosis of the loop. In “Mercedes,” the bassline never changes, but there’s a clear shift halfway through as a plangent synth lead assumes center stage, followed by a zither-like patch and then a plucky synthetic harp; it’s structured almost like a jazz ensemble, with each voice taking a turn.\nHe does something similar at the climax of “Squidward’s Viola,” when cybernetic frogs and loons suddenly clear the path for a soaring viola solo. It’s a striking moment: Here at the heart of a carefree and occasionally rambunctious record, he brushes aside all the goofiness in favor of an exceptionally lyrical passage of deep, plaintive feeling. A minimal revival has been underway for a while, but it’s gambits like these that setElvers Passapart. Kuning’s well aware of what’s come before, but he seems far more interested in where he might go next."

Surreal, intense, and anxiety-inducing—and full of memorable threats to urinate onZedd—it was among the best early hyperpop efforts, adopting the most pranksterish aspects ofPC Music’s hyperreal vision of pop. As the progenitors of the genre have moved toward sleeker, more stylish versions of the sound—whether that’s embracing bleary-eyed shoegaze or fried internet rap, or sometimes both—two housereflects the duo’s determination to double down, jettisoning anything resembling subtlety or restraint in favor of broken-glowstick maximalism.\nThe approach is most evident when food house go full “terminal brainrot,” which they memorably diagnose themselves with on “vitamin d freestyle.” The beat of “IDGAFOS,” for example, flips between jittery East Coast club music, queasy IDM abstractions, and ascendant house gestures. Fraxiom, meanwhile, cuts through the chaos with a pitch-shifted whine, rapping about lolcows, enemas, and scoliosis. It’sa lot, but that’s the point. It’s music by and for people who spend too much time online, which is an easy way to end up feeling as burned out and overwhelmed as the music does."

    "review_text": "Little Simz’sLotusis the music-industry equivalent of a slash-and-burn harvest, where once-fertile land is razed and set ablaze, flooding the soil with nutrients. Earlier this year, theMercury Prize-winning rappersued her former producer and childhood friend Inflo for allegedly failing to repay a loan of £1.7 million (~$2.3 million). A majority of the money had gone toward funding an extravagant live performance bySAULT, the enigmatic collective led by Inflo and his wife, R&B starCleo Sol; his alleged failure to pay back the debt left Simz unable to pay her taxes for 2024. Simz lost one of her oldest friends and her closest creative collaborator; Inflo had produced each of her three albums since 2019’sGREY Area. OnLotus, the fallout from the conflict becomes fuel for her creativity.\nSimz started and scrapped four different full-length projects (each of which were worked on with Inflo) betweenLotusand the release ofNO THANK YOUin 2022. She has admitted to grappling with self-doubt throughout the album’s creation, but, emboldened by her trial, Simz emerges from the emotional wilderness spitting with a bristling intensity that manifests in a focus absent from her recent projects. With new producer Miles Clinton James at the helm ofLotus, she puts her interpersonal issues on display with a (sometimes) deft touch; it’s a thorough excavation of the graveyard of one’s ego and closest relationships.\nOn past albums, Simz’s topical scope has been vast, with varying degrees of success: she hip-fired at the music industry’s exploitation of Black artistry onNO THANK YOUand probed her psyche on 2021’sSometimes I Might Be Introvert.Within those expansive arcs, the strongest moments were when Simz took aim at specific targets, whether external or internal. It’s that energy that makes the opener “Thief” an invigorating entry point. Post-punk guitars crawl in the background, giving the production a murky, forlorn atmosphere, as Simz lays into an unnamed malefactor, presumably Inflo, for his transgressions against her. Simz tells him that she feels “sorry for your wife,” calls him a “devil in disguise,” and accuses him of having no artistic direction until she came along. In the pantheon of diss tracks, it sits alongsideLauryn Hill’s evisceration ofWyclef Jeanon “Lost Ones,” unflinchingly wielding familiarity as a weapon.\nSimz has likened the new album to her diary, tellingThe Guardian“I really just put my life out there.” In the past, in her weakest moments, Simz would overload lines with syllables, her rapid pace washing away the meaning of her raps. Here, the intended transparency carries over to the way she structures her bars, as though it were just you and her in the room: “They ask why I’m starvin’ the streets?/This nigga tryna hold my shit up/I’ll never forget when you told me, give up/And that my big dreams were far from a reach,” she raps on “Hollow,” playing with the gas pedal to vary her delivery. Her plainspoken, tempered tone pops with personality, making her strongest musings land with the impact of an exploding bullet. When, over a sparse drumbeat, piano, and acoustic guitar (“Lonely”), Simz spits about being on the verge of quitting music, or reveals that paranoia has her peeking out the window like Malcolm X (“Lotus”), it all begins to feel like a therapy session that you can’t tear yourself away from."

    "review_text": "At this point,Snoop Doggis famous for being famous. He’s been America’s affable, couch-locked uncle for over 20 years now, skating on his delightfully weird personality to earn gigs likebonkers sketch comedyhost,celebrity roastmaster, and primetimeOlympics correspondent. He countsWillie Nelsonand Martha Stewart as close personal friends, and, even as he settles into his 50s, still has the juice todefine the discoursefor a few days at a time.\nFor years, music has seemed like a bit of an afterthought for the rapper who once helped define the West Coast gangster-rap template. His 1993 debut,Doggystyle, remains his most (perhaps only) essential release. He’s done stints as aNo Limit soldier, an ambassador of theStar Trak/Virginia Beach sound, and aborn-again Rastafarian. And there are gems sprinkled throughout his three-decade body of work, like 2013’sDâm-Funkcollaboration7 Days of Funk, the vibey mid-life stock-taking of 2017’sNeva Left, and the undeniable bombshell “Sensual Seduction” (the explicit version, “Sexual Eruption,” lays it on a little too thick). But there are also plenty of missteps, like 2024’sMissionary, a second full-length album withDr. Dre(their previous record together wasDoggystyle, get it?) that vacillates betweenmildly entertainingandkind ofembarrassing.\nThese days, his records mostly feel like low-stakes kickbacks, as if he dropped decent money on studio time but still made sure everyone got home by five.Iz It a Crime?, his 21st album and third as CEO of the recently resurrected Death Row Records, is slick and frictionless, unencumbered by anything resembling overthinking. It’s an aggressively OK listen, full of expensive-sounding, groove-first songs that don’t really lead anywhere, except maybe to the cooler to grab another cold one. This is session beer music, best when played at mid-volume on a nice day, augmenting the vibe without ever overtaking a conversation.\nIf you decide to pay attention, you’ll find a mix of occasionally tight songwriting and some utterly bizarre choices. The album starts with a surprisingly inspired four-song suite, a revitalized-sounding Snoop dropping into the pocket like melting caramel. He flexes a bouncy, spring-loaded flow on the lush,Sade-sampling title track, and the satisfying “Sophisticated Crippin’” feels like a West Coast version ofRick Ross’ gold-plated opulence onDeeper Than Rap. Things start to get shaky with “Can’t Wait,” a synth-funk cut that features Bay Area rapperLaRussell, whose verse is essentially about how cool it is to be on a jam with Snoop (a concept that gets the full treatment on the thumping-but-vacuousSexyy Redcollab “Me N OG Snoop”). The wheels come entirely off with “Can’t Get Enough,” a grown and sexy ballad that bringsIz It a Crime?’s momentum to a screeching halt. Though it’s about relationship longevity, Snoop sings his verses with a muted version ofRihanna’sbellicose delivery on “Bitch Better Have My Money,” explaining to his lady that he will “fuck up [her] mind.”"

    "review_text": "As the 20th century tripped into the new millennium, dark energy rippled through the universe thatBill Callahanhad dreamed into being. The music he’d spent the previous decade creating asSmoghad maintained a tenuous balance of bleak beauty and wry humor. Then, for a minute there, with 1999’s revelatoryKnock Knock—a breakup record and a finding-himself record that featured some of the most unburdened songwriting of his career—it seemed like maybe he’d turned a corner, tamed some demons. “For the first time in my life/I am moving away moving away moving away/From within the reach of me,” he sang on “Held,” as if the speaker’s soul was a Mylar balloon escaping the white-knuckled fist of a bitter, stunted man-child.\nBut gravity’s a hell of a drag, and with 2000’sDongs of Sevotionand 2001’sRain on Lens, Callahan was back down in the muck with his usual cast of characters:disappointing siblings,obsessive nihilists,ambivalent shut-ins, and, above all, unreliable men with broken moral compasses. In December 2001, wrapped in this darkness, he and his touring bandmates—drummerJim White, violinist Jessica Billey, and guitarist Mike Saenz—stepped into the BBC’s Maida Vale studios. The set they recorded that day withJohn Peel, two Smog originals and two covers, has finally made its way to record, billed asThe Holy Grail. Despite its tongue-in-cheek title, for the Callahan faithful, it’s a fantastic find—a snapshot of the artist and his band at their most stripped down, highlighting his music’s sinister yet generous essence. The inclusion of two covers, something of a rarity in Callahan’s repertoire—and not just any two covers;the Velvet UndergroundandFleetwood Mac, of all bands—only sweetens the deal.\nCritics in those years, particularly in the UK, tended to treat Callahan like an incurable pessimist; the Smog songs that Callahan chose that day certainly don’t seem meant to disabuse them of that notion. Both tracks prod ominously at the ambiguous sexual underbelly of his work, stirring up uncomfortable questions about how much we’re meant to sympathize with the songs’ grim protagonists.\n“Cold Discovery,” fromDongs of Sevotion, doesn’t sound unduly severe at first. Where the album version weaves flanged guitar, piano accents, and whispering drums into a downy two-chord shuffle, the Peel version is stark and unadorned, with a hint of distortion on the twinned guitars, and brushes on the drums hissing out a funereal beat. Still, there’s something hypnotic about its rising and falling motion; the sweetness of Callahan’s baritone papers over the hints of desolation in the lyrics. He sings of warm returns and bitter leave-takings; the first stanza might conceivably be about a beloved stray cat. But he lets loose with the chorus: “I could hold a woman down on a hardwood floor,” an incongruously sing-song lilt coloring his voice. The band surges like ocean swells, reflecting shades ofSwans’ orSonic Youth’s steely dronescapes. He repeats the line, as though rubbing our faces in it. But as in most Callahan songs, there’s a twist. The violence, if that’s what it is, is reciprocal, as her teeth “gnash right through me/Looking for a soft place.” The “cold discovery” of the title is his fundamental lack: Searching for empathy and vulnerability, his lover finds none. It’s a damning self-assessment."

    "review_text": "A rapper, a streamer, and a leaker step into a vehicle. Who’s sitting behind the wheel?\nOsamaSoncould probably tell you. En route to the biggest release of his young career, the 21-year-old spitfire has been riding shotgun. The amount of his music that’s leaked in the past year forced several delays for his highly anticipated third album,Jump Out. Osama’s fans spent 2024 begging for official versions of songs meant to stay private,songsthatcould’vegone on the album if only leakers hadn’t already released them. Last summer, Osama pulled up on Kick streamer BruceDropEmOff for a livestream and witnessed a songleak in real time. Just three weeks earlier, he’d had400 songs leakedin one go. And it’s not for no reason: After breaking out with two back-to-back projects, 2023’sOsama SeasonandFlex Musix, the South Carolina rapper has become the figurehead of post-COVIDSoundCloud—a high-octane, 808-driven destructionist. Songs like “Trenches” are the reason why iPhones come with headphone warnings; the onslaught of bass paired with OsamaSon’s strained, exigent punch-ins are a match made in hell (that’s a compliment).\nSince emerging two summers ago, Osama’snot-so-discreetadulation forPlayboi Cartihas been a subject of scrutiny. The influence manifests in his music, inoldvisualizers, andcover art; some have even compared their’fit pics. But in the same way thatCash Cartionce usedChief Keef’ssoundas a launchpad, Osama melds his favorite rapper’s early echoic staccato into something more corrosive. There’s a thin line between mimicry and reinvention, and OsamaSon has gradually nudged past the threshold. OnJump Out, his sound is as distinct as it’s ever been, resulting in some of his most bone-shattering work to date. At 18 tracks, the album can at times feel exhausting, but its torrential downpour of synths and 808s is ultimately rewarding.\nCarnage propagates in every crevice of this record. The seismic jolt of “Fool,” the demented showmanship of “Round of Applause”; it’s all brazen by design. If the drums sound like they’re suffocating the mix, it’s because they’re supposed to. When the beats crackle on “GTFO the Room” or “Mufasa,” I feel like a kid in Florida again, watching SUVs slide by with speakers so loud you could feel the music more than you could hear it. Is it jarring? Sure, maybe. But all I remember thinking back then was, “What song was that guy playing?” A major architect behind this sound andJump Out’s overall chaos is Charlotte-born beatsmithok, the album’s executive producer, who’s credited on 15 tracks. Practically every rapper born after 9/11 has a song with that “ok is the hardest” tag on it (Glokk40spaz,xaviersobased,fakemink,YhapoJJ); last year, he executive-producedNettspend’sBAD ASS F*CKING KID. Inevitable is an understatement. On lead single “The Whole World Is Free,” ok presents Osama with the brightest, most forward-thinking piece in his catalog: A feverish, polychromaticSkrillexflipcompletely submerged by volcanic percussion."

    "review_text": "DERBY’s debut albumSluggerpresents an interesting paradox: How can an albumthisderivative also feel authentic, even original? Single “Gold” seems like a slick attempt to recreateDijon’s fast and free songwriting magic, his big-feeling bravado, his Americana-twanged R&B; “Jenny” draws clear inspiration fromAlex G; his frequent use of pitch-shifted vocals and flanged guitars are siphoned from the Bible ofBlonde.Yet DERBY—a Houston native who now lives in New York and whose real name is Craig Caldwell—has talent that continues to reveal itself even after you clock the comparisons and a perspective that cuts through the references.Sluggercaptures a world of quotidian intensity and rural nostalgia: shooting a deer through the eyes with a double-barrel shotgun, blasting the radio on a hundred-degree day, dancing in the kitchen with your sweetheart as rain pings the tin roof, watching TV together after an argument, wondering who’ll apologize first. These scenes feel fresh within DERBY’s off-kilter sonic palate, his quixotic romanticism shot through with a touch of dirty realism.\nDERBY has been careful to keep his personal life, and image, out of the spotlight. The avatar forSlugger’s art and promotional materials is a deer; the few photos of him online are taken at twilight, his eyes and face shadowed by a camo hat. His only other release, 2021’sHiraeth,has a few interesting moments but fails to produce a song worth listening to again. Although remaining mysterious has its advantages—most listeners will encounter DERBY with no context, expectation, or visual association—not establishing a unique persona may hinder an artist hoping to avoid the Dijon andFrank Oceancopycat tag. But in a hyper-commodified, identity-forward industry, it’s admirable for DERBY to eschew an elaborate public presence, to stand behind his art and allow the music to communicate whatever it will.\nAnd his music, fortunately, needs no out-of-frame persona to work its wonders. His plug-in-warped indie pop bears traces of folk and rap, emo and outlaw country, R&B and hyperpop.Slugger’s songs are scaffolded by warbly guitars and dry drum kits, its melodies simple and arresting. DERBY’s voice is almost always pitched up and routed through plate reverb, phaser, and Auto-Tune, a form of masking that makes it easier to be excessively vulnerable in his writing. Opener “Deer in the Belly of the Snake” roils with analog hiss and aggressive pitch correction, which serve as the perfect cloaks for DERBY to sad rap some of his most cutting lines: “Sucks, suck it up/Sucker punch to the teeth/Teach you how to speak in his name/Show you how to act in his presence/Lessons burned into your brain.” Elsewhere he’s getting into fist fights and admitting he’s a bastard, shivering violently while begging his baby to come home. These scenes don’t come across as cloying or cheap in part because it’s all so startlingly sincere. DERBY’s searching far and wide for connection and forgiveness, hoping something somewhere can eradicate all that painful, inconsolable stuff inside him.\nThe best songs arrive as unique bursts of inspiration, limber expressions of DERBY’s genre-agnostic sensibilities. “Glow” layers pedal steel with jersey club percussion, DERBY’s sped-up singing floating over spacy guitar chords, while “Money Fight” feels plucked from a childhood memory, its emotional core urgent and disorienting, its climax building and sloping and stampeding toward irresolution.Sluggercan lose its dream-like momentum when the ideas feel forced and over-considered, like on the Alex G-indebted “Jenny” or the sedated closer “Armored,” neither of which home in on their emotional potential. Still,Sluggeris one of the most surprising indie pop records of the year, an album that understands something sacred about art-making: If you lay yourself as bare as possible, something special is almost certain to emerge."

    "review_text": "Star 99are a punk band who make writing a great pop song look easy. If most West Coast pop-punk can be traced back toJawbreaker, the San Jose quintet have inherited their knack for knowing which moments call for a sugary refrain and which call for a tortured shred. The band’s self-deprecating charm recalls both the early-career highlights of MTV-to-Warped Tour giants likeGreen DayandWeezerand 2010s Bandcamp cult favorites likethe SidekicksandSwearin’, recontextualized to encapsulate Gen-Z dead-end malaise. There’s a scrappiness and spontaneity to Star 99’s sound—as if you’d just happened to walk by one of their open-garage-door jam sessions. Masters of keeping their frenetic power-pop short and sweet (though not for lack of good ideas), Star 99 dare to ask, “What if the best part of the song wasall of it?”\nOn opener “Kill,” Saoirse Alesandro doesn’t set the scene so much as she shoves you in like it’s the neighborhood pool: “Sun’s out/The campus is locked/We’re like cicadas/Our skin peeling off/All starved and screeching/Last 13 years down the drain.” Alesandro’s songwriting is grounded in storytelling and image, channeling post-adolescent frustration into snarky quips (“You’re a hometown beauty now that everyone’s gone”) and resigned disappointment (“Steam from hot rice and essays for college/Not enough money so I’ll stay in town”). ThroughoutGaman, she shares songwriting and vocal duties with Thomas Calvo, who favors wandering vignettes and fragmented confessionalism. The two find common ground in their penchant for bottling nervous energy into compact, combustible hooks and setting them off with no time to spare.\nOn “IWLYG,” Calvo’s vocal melodies soar over buzzing guitars and sun-drenched cymbals to eulogize a relationship that’s worn out its welcome. “You’re a see-through person, you are invisible to me,” he sighs. “Gray Wall” is its thematic inverse, as Calvo and Alesandro trade musings about words left unsaid over a drum machine that sounds like it could be a sample from “Tom’s Diner.” It’s an outlier, but it works as a mid-album breather, and a reminder that while Star 99 can write a straightforward guitar record, they’re not afraid to deviate from genre conventions.\nThe titleGamanis a Japanese word for a Zen Buddhist concept that roughly translates to “enduring the unbearable with patience or dignity.” Before closing on a reprise of the opening track’s refrain, Alesandro admits, “They won’t build statues of me/My life will not be biographied/But I love you so much/And I am so lucky.” It’s a full-circle celebration of small victories, knowing that sooner or later the record will flip and she’ll be back at the bottom of the hill. Sometimes, Alesandro’s songwriting recalls another Northern Californian coming-of-age story about feeling both loved and suffocated by one’s home: that of Saoirse Ronan’s character inLady Bird. In Lady Bird’s descriptions of Sacramento, a nun named Sister Joan reads more love than Lady Bird intended. “I guess I pay attention,” Lady Bird admits, to which Sister Joan replies, “Don’t you think they are the same thing, love and attention?” Star 99 are outgrowing their hometown while still stuck there, paying it close—one might even sayloving—attention."

    "review_text": "“Dumb Feeling,” the opening track from Mei Semones’ debut albumAnimaru, is the only song I’ve ever heard about New York that is rooted, firmly, in ambivalence. “This is a special place/But how many days do I/Really feel/I think I’m special, too?” the 24-year-old Berklee College of Music grad sings without a whiff of pity-party. “If you have nothing to say/No need to try so hard… It’s more fun to listen to/Other’s words.”\nIn high school, Semones cut her teeth as a guitarist playing in jazz combos, which perhaps accounts for her attitude of attunement to being super-present. Its impact is certainly evident in the dexterity of her guitar-playing and the cleanliness with which she and her band—Noah Leong (viola), Claudius Agrippa (violin), Noam Tanzer (bass), and Ransom McCafferty (drums)—hybridize bossa nova, indie, and J-pop. (Semones sings in both English and Japanese.) There is no muddied meandering through genre onAnimaru. Everything is measured and mannered. To put it plainly: It’s very, very nice.\nThere’s nothing wrong with that! The musicianship is undeniably tight, and the band makes use of the most velvety bits of its source genres. Semones herself has said she wants her music to be a soft landing place: “The music that I love makes me feel less alone,” she told a radio host in 2024. She looks for music to give her “something to relate to,” and aims for her songs to do the same for other listeners. On the math-ed out room-filler “I can do what I want,” Semones sings about rejecting conformity (“I don't mind if you look at me/I am going to do this the way I want to do it”), while the breathy and sweet “Norwegian Shag” finds her lamenting a past version of her life: “I wonder is there/A part of me still with you,” she sings, “Things I told myself to make it hurt a little bit less.” The video for “Zarigani,” an ode to her twin sister, is a squad-goals fantasy: Semones imagines herself crewed up when she is, in fact, on her own—alone but not lonely, invoking summers with her sibling catching crayfish in their native Michigan.\nThe album is named after the Japanese pronunciation of the word “animal,” and its lyrics are often attuned to encounters with the non-human. The stripped-back “Donguri” is full of forest-friend surrealist non-sequiturs, replete with a hair-pulling squirrel and a hide-and-seek-playing snake. Although Semones doesn’t anthropomorphize her creatures, I found myself thinking about the narrator of Leonora Carrington’s “The Debutante,” a girl whose only friend is a hyena at the zoo. “Rat with Wings,”Animaru’s epic, sounds like it’s about a break-up (“My mind is with you still/But I’ll never want you back”) but is actually a paean to a pigeon waddling after cloud shadows and resting alongside trash—a funny, strange subversion of heartbreak clichés."

    "review_text": "A few months ago,André 3000succinctly explained the creative philosophy that has animated his unlikely pivot to ambient-jazz flautist. “Sometimes, mastering shit can get boring,” the formerOutKastmember toldRolling Stone. “I’d rather go amateur interesting than master boring.”\nI kept thinking of André’s eccentric credo while listening to this exhilarating debut (well… sort of) fromSharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory. While Van Etten hasn’t transformed into a flute-toting vagabond (yet), she has spent the latter half of her career moving away from anything resembling a comfort zone. After taking her smoke-damaged indie-folk sound as far as it could go on her fourth album, 2014’sAre We There, the singer took a break from music and embraced being a novice again, making her acting debut on Netflix’s short-livedThe OAand going back to school to study psychology. Eventually, she reemerged with 2019’sRemind Me Tomorrow, an extraordinary album wrought from atmospheric synths and curdled dread.\nIf 2022’sWe’ve Been Going About This All Wrongfelt like a slight retreat—a yearning for domestic comfort amid disasters both global (pandemic) and local (the wildfires depicted on the album cover)—its follow-up signals another new beginning. Or newband, rather, as this one’s billed not as a solo album but a record written in full collaboration with Van Etten’s bandmates, newly dubbed the Attachment Theory. Why form a band sixteen years into a celebrated solo career? Why not? During rehearsals for her 2022 tour, Van Etten grew tired of her own voice and impulsively asked her band to “just jam.” The experiment yielded two songs—the spiky post-punk workout “I Can’t Imagine (Why You Feel This Way)” and sludgy, disquieted “Southern Life (What It Must Be Like)”—and left the singer “feeling very inspired.”\nIt wasn’t a fluke. OnSharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory, the frontwoman surrenders to the rhythm on a stormy, unsettled album centered on groove and mood. In lieu of verse-chorus structures, songs circle around mantra-like motifs, swirling and intensifying like tornado winds. “Who wants to live forever?” she wonders over and over on the stunning opener, flipping the aspirational immortality ofOasis’ssame-named hiton its head as spectral synths from keyboardist Teeny Lieberson lead the way. Inspired by Van Etten’s friendship with a fan who died young from a chronic illness, “Afterlife” goes even bigger, reflecting the widescreen grandeur ofRemind Me Tomorrowstandout “Seventeen.” Grasping at all the big stuff—life, love, mortality—the song evokes the specter of a connection so strong it makes you want to believe in the fantasy of reunion after death: “Turned me inside out and now I find/I want to see you in the afterlife,” Van Etten croons."

    "review_text": "In a recentarticle on romantasy—the term for books that combine elements of romance and fantasy—Sarah Brouillette ascribes the genre’s recent runaway success to frustration with contemporary heteronormativity. She writes, “Women want something different from their relationships with men. So different that it can only be figured as alien.” This is to say: It’s easier to imagine partnership with a werewolf than it is to love your oppressor. But the pain of withstanding relationships under patriarchy can also make us feel alien to ourselves. A fanged green swamp creature adorns the cover of Queens-based artistduendita’s recorda strong desire to survive—a representation, the artist says, of the adaptations we make in the face of these struggles, all while we still seek to love and be loved. The album is an exercise and an exorcism, a syrupy R&B odyssey that confronts pain, monstrousness, and the pain that makes us monstrous.\nduendita’s voice lashes togethera strong desire to survive, whose disparate parts might otherwise seem incoherent. It’s our guide through the underworld of trauma, arcing into gale-force a cappella alongside a choir at the end of “baby teeth” only to segue into jazzy crooning at the opening of “break the silence.” “No means no,” the choir sings before duendita admits, “Different day, still face the pain/Won’t go away” over a skittering beat. The notes deepen and duendita’s vocals quiet as they near the track’s end, pleading, “Listen when we speak/Respect our boundaries.”\nThis isn’t allusive or gestural—these lyrics leave little room for interpretation. “One wrong night, it was violence,” they mourn on “why i didn’t report.” Later, on “all mine,” they declare “I want to heal and be safe/I want to dance and make mistakes/Be brave and be great.” Bodily unease and mistrust pervadesa strong desire to survive, as does, well: a strong desire to survive. Later, duendita expresses the feeling that they’re “trapped inside my life,” mistrustful and paranoid but determined to overcome. We toggle between defeat and defiance on the nonlinear path of grief.\nThe album’s despair is powerfully grounded by its sound. On standout “baby teeth,” their evocative vocalization and powerful range evokeANOHNIandBillie Holiday. Airy, spare production adds a haunted quality to the song, as if duendita’s voice is a specter that reaches through space and time. It’s like watching someone swallow a sword, or saw themselves in half on a stage. You’re rapt and wincing. The moment when they sing “Here I am/I know myself like no other can,” the lyric transcends the diaristic and becomes an incantation. There is a grunt in the song, a fissure where we sense the labor of plumbing these depths. On “hammock,” too, duendita’s expressive, acrobatic vocal lines take center stage, flitting over a simple piano line and gentle, murmured harmonies. As other voices enter the conversation—a deep rumble, a few gamboling samples—the throughline of the central melody still holds, a wail that cedes into fritzing electronica."

Since then, Strange has remained impossible to pin down, reveling in his contradictions on 2022’sFarm to Tableand refusing to dial down his Blackness to suit predominantly white indie-rock spaces. Strange isn’t the kind of artist who siloes his various alter egos into differently named aliases, like, say,MF DOOM. They’re all Bartees Strange. “Princeis an amazing electronic artist, an amazing rock artist, an amazing pop artist,” the Baltimore-based musician recentlytold an interviewer. “But he’s just Prince, you know? That’s what I want.”\nOn his third album,Horror, Strange is no longer the scrappy underdog he once was. He’s now an established name, with a headlining tour under his belt and producer-to-the-starsJack Antonoffjoining him in the studio. But, as a million boilerplate music biopics will tell you, success doesn’t wash away insecurities, and onHorror, a loose concept album aboutfacing his deepest fears, Strange confronts many of his own, from nagging career doubts (“Wants Needs”) to romantic strife (“Lovers”). It’s a deceptively confident album about navigating a lack of confidence—not nearly as macabre as its artwork, which outfits Strange like the vampire hunter Blade, might suggest, but instead mired in the mundanely messy work of searching for safety and companionship in a world of dread.\n“I need somebody to hold me down to the earth,” Strange sings on Antonoff-produced opener “Too Much,” an uneasy love letter to himself that lurches from falsetto-laced soul to free-associative rap-rock and back again. The artist’s genre-hopping is intact, but the production is slicker this time, and the leaps don’t always land: “Too Much” leads into “Hit It Quit It,” a funk-rock groove that’s supple and light on its feet but never funky enough to live up to itsSly StoneandStevie Wondername-checks. The throbbing, nocturnal house of “Lovers” makes for a compelling sequel toLive Foreverdeep cut “Flagey God,” but the hip-hop travelogue “Norf Gun,” a collaboration with the rap duoThey Hate Change, can’t summon enough globe-trotting exuberance to transcend its toothless pop-rap backing.\nThis time around, those sharp tonal shifts, like the faux-spooky album cover, feel a little like red herrings. The heart ofHorrorlies in a mellower suite of songs that cull from soul and retro AOR touchstones—stirring songs in which Strange yearns for a measure of stability and acceptance. “Sober” unlocks some nascentFleetwood Macgene in Strange’s songwriting, with driving rhythms and a huge, swelling climax, while “Baltimore” is restrained but gorgeous, a soft-rock meditation on culture clash and the fraught business of finding somewhere to settle down in a country steeped in racism: “When I think about places I could live,” Strange croons, “I wonder if one’s good enough to raise a few Black kids.” The richly textured “Lie 95” is equally impressive, a song about searching for love that packs big hooks, and big heart, in its ’80s-nostalgia moodboard. “I feel focused,” Strange yowls, “on lifting you up.” Even when he’s mired in his own fears, a spirit of generosity animates his writing."

    "review_text": "Roger Watersheard what everyone inGenesiswas saying about him. In a 1975interviewaround the release ofWish You Were Here, thePink Floydbassist and vocalist responded to his peers’ suggestion that they were aiming forrealart, while Pink Floyd, whose records were now selling in the millions, had grown more interested in appealing to the lowest common denominator and fading into the background.\nWhile the word “diplomatic” is rarely used to describe Waters, he managed to address this criticism with a distinct lack of rancor. Here’s what he posits: Unlikely scenario, but, if someday Genesis—a whimsical prog band who just lost their visionary frontman and who would, within a year, release an album partially inspired by the novels of Emily Brontë—someday achieve the mainstream success enjoyed by Pink Floyd—a band so popular that characterizing them as “prog” feels somewhat minimizing, like callingStar Warsa “sci-fi” film—then there’s a good chance that they, too, would loosen their distinctions between high and low art.\nThen in his early 30s, Waters was testing a theory about how rock stars might age gracefully in this miserable industry. It had been less than a decade since Pink Floyd’s artful and inventive debut, 1967’sThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but they had already endured enough transformations, upended so many expectations, and achieved so many artistic highs as to feel like their best work could well be behind them. Looking back on the massive success of 1973’sThe Dark Side of the Moon—a commercial and creative breakthrough that changed their lives forever—he came to understand what makes art connect with the masses. For better or worse, he decided, people were attracted to the chase: the ambition that drives us to even believe we could make something likeDark Side of the Moon. Once you do it, the story is over. “Wish You Were Here,” he explains, “came about by us going on in spite of the fact we’d finished.”\nAt first, the creative process was just as labored as he makes it sound. The band—Waters, David Gilmour on guitar and vocals, Richard Wright on keys, Nick Mason on drums—was lost. Distracted. New songs emerged but they lacked any unifying theme. When they tested new material on the road, music journalists did what we sometimes do, which is to turn our backs on good bands when they get too popular, relitigate them based on their fame, and suggest the edge is gone—if there ever was an edge!—and, at the very least, the thing that once felt like magic has started to become stale. “The Floyd in fact seem so incredibly tired and seemingly bereft of true creative ideas,” Nick Kentwrotein a 1974 issue ofNME, “one wonders if they really care about their music anymore.”"

    "review_text": "Seen from afar, coverage of Madrid’s trebly, chrome-coated experimental pop scene appears dominated byRusia-IDK, the five-member boys’ club formed in 2019 that countsRalphie Chooand Rusowsky among its marquee names.AMORE, aka Murcia’s 25-year-old María Moreno Martinez, has been active for almost as long; her body of work is a similarly genre-omnivorous playground where flamenco, hip-hop,glitchcore, and Latin folk are all fair game. Ina short filmaccompanying her newTop Hits, Ballads, etc…, a dozen women participate in a strange silent disco on a smoke-filled soundstage. This video, like the record, takes place at the intersection of high concept and limited resources; listening toTop Hits, one pictures the neon lines of gaffer’s tape on the floor. If Choo is themad scientist, AMORE is the performance artist offering an X-ray view into her process.\nFrom title onward,Top Hits, Ballads, etc…registers more like a compilation than a proper debut. “Last Maria on Earth” and “Querió,” each more than a year old, mark the album’s two furthest musical poles. “Last Maria” is strummy indie rock graced by a fluttering flute and Martínez’s ethereal vocals, while the castanets and syncopated jota rhythms of “Querió” situate it in a lineage of contemporary takes on traditional Spanish folk. The entirety ofTop Hitshovers well above 70 Hz—nothing here truly throbs or wobbles. “I Gotta Feeling” wants to be nothing short of your nextBlack Eyed Peas-sized bar mitzvah banger, but lands onNeptunes-lite as Martínez and producerDinamarcamuster up a pixelated elysium of finger-snaps, flutes, and taffy-pulled basslines with plenty of room to breathe.\nMuch ofTop Hitsostensibly chronicles a queer breakup; as the guitar balladry of “Amiga” glitches in and out of focus, Martínez recalls “una amiga/Y aunque no la cuidé como debía/Se convirtió en mi dulce compañía” (“a friend/And even though I didn’t care for her like I should have/She became my sweet company”). In the last minute, “Amiga” flips into its own self-contained remix, slicing her voice into silky ribbons over a muted kick drum. Amid the hypnotic ghungroos bells of “Peléame!!!,” an angelic host of AMOREs command a lover to “fight me, light it up”; a few tracks later she’s hitting bottom again. The playful groove of “Delirio”—a baby Pokémon evolution on from the skeletal reggaeton experiments ofRosalía’sMOTOMAMI—belies Martínez’s lyrics, which compare her love to “una prisión” (a prison), “un castigo” (a punishment), “[una] maldición” (a curse). And like any good telenovela, there’s only one way this story can end: with a gunshot.\nThis might suggest thatTop Hitsis all high drama, but Martínez is incapable of total self-seriousness. “Juvenil” ends on a scattering of canned applause; “Amore I,” a collaboration with Toronto-based producerLoukeman, is circled by chiptune cherubs; interlude “dont mess with mr in-between” draws on synth presets straight out of C418’sMinecraftsoundtrack. The field’s wide open and certain songs still feel unformed; “Evangelion” begins as a dreamyJulee Cruisewaltz but proceeds as though someone forgot to toggle off the loop button. Though closer to a collection of demos,Top Hits, Ballads, etc…is a delightfully half-baked proof of concept. The ellipsis says it all: not a best-of, just a best-so-far."

    "review_text": "Tell me if you’ve heard this before: an artist, looking for a career reset after a few big swings and misses, decides to make arealalbum, a “stripped-down” record, one unburdened by whatever commercial confusions preceded it. George Lewis Jr., who performs asTwin Shadow, finds himself in such a position after a decade of unsuccessfully chasing Top 40 hits. So he “ditched traditional labels, agents, management, and drums,” per a note he wrote on Instagram, kicked everyone out of the studio, and picked up his guitar, hoping isolation would allow him to tap into something raw and honest. The result isGeorgie,a stirring and, yes, stripped-down alt-R&B album that’s both beautiful and aimless, its emotional depths floating in a distant haze just out of frame.\nIn nearly two decades as Twin Shadow, Lewis has gone from weirdo indiewunderkindto glitzy ’80s soft-rockrevivalistto a vibey pop impressionist in the vein ofBruno Mars. After releasing a pair of spectacular albums in the early 2010s, Lewis looked poised to become an indie rock darling à laEzra KoenigorJames Murphy, his nostalgia-core new wave as danceable as it was studious. But why settle for darling status? Lewis was notshyabout wanting to loft into the pop star firmament, his more recent albums flailing with main-stage festival ambitions, One Direction-style bangers, and airport-lounge anthems. The problem wasn’t the desire for mainstream success but the lack of good songs; Lewis’ foray into glossy pop sacrificed the looseness and originality that made his early work shine.\nGeorgieisn’t just a palate cleanser—it’s a bar of soap in your mouth. Lewis strips away the kitschy pop artifice and turns inward, siloing himself with his electric guitar and a few synthesizers to sing about his “deepest, darkest, and brightest feelings,” as he wrote in advance of the album. His father died when he was finishing the record, further punctuating the pain and loss baked into the songwriting.Georgieis still architected like a pop album, its hooks the highpoints of pretty much every track, but it’s refreshing to hear Lewis reconnect with an angsty, exploratory sound and to play with melody and texture in clever, inspired ways.\nThe most effective moments onGeorgiefuse Lewis’ pop instincts with lo-fi, scrappy production. “Good Times” and “Permanent Feeling” are potential hits masquerading as MTV Unplugged performances. (He wrote both songs with Sophie Hintze, the album’s only listed collaborator.) The choice to pare down and restrain his maximalist tendencies leads to some genuinely moving moments, the nakedness of the arrangements forcing him to carefully attend to their component parts. On “As Soon As You Can,” a dour guitar riff and amp feedback are ornamentation enough to croon one of the finest songs of his career. “Standing in a Publix parking lot, a hundred-ten degrees/Getting back from Brenton’s lake, pulling gravel from our knees,” he mumbles, a spacy synth filling the dead space behind his voice. Lewis’ writing can leave something to be desired—heartbreak looks like “dead rose” metaphors and “you sure left a scar” tropes—but occasionally he nails the nexus between specificity and generality."

    "review_text": "Triplawas born from memory. WhenLush’s Miki Berenyi published her 2022 memoirFingers Crossed: How Music Saved Me From Success, she knew she would get requests to play a few songs at readings. The sound she and her band had created in the ’90s—a dreamy take on shoegaze that could drift like dandelion fuzz on a kind breeze—would be virtually impossible to replicate on her own. After recruiting bassist Oliver Cherer and guitarist KJ “Moose” McKillop for a makeshift trio and playing a few bookstores with a drum machine for backing, she began to write new material with her new bandmates.Tripla, theMika Bereyni Trio’s first album, sounds bruised by the passage of time, even as it refuses to indulge in nostalgia. Like any good autobiography, it deals patiently with the past without trying to recreate it.\nWhileTriplais respectful of Lush’s sound—the wafer-thin reed of Berenyi’s soprano has hardly dulled with time—the music takes a playful attitude toward that band’s records. Freed from the complications of her working partnership with Lush cofounderEmma Anderson, Berenyi and her trio stroll across genres and through moods with a wanderer’s pleasure; the way she breezes through the vocal of the psychedelic disco “Big I Am” suggests she would’ve made an inspired collaborator for DFA in the mid aughts. The end result across the album is close to dream pop, but the songs’ lyrical grounding in the present lend a tetchy air, closer to the bleary-eyed feeling of being freshly awakened than to the pristine world of slumber.\nIn the album’s first and best track, the McKillop-penned “8th Deadly Sin,” a cascade of melancholy pours from Berenyi’s 12-string guitar. It’s a song about our collective difficulty taking environmental collapse seriously, and just as Berenyi sings about “plastic lives” and the difficulty in distinguishing skeletons from trees, the relentless thump of the kick drum and a swirl of programmed synth try to pull her away, enacting the same distraction the lyric laments. It’s gorgeous and immensely sad; the song may be about the destruction of the physical world, but the way Berenyi delivers it makes it feel like it’s about decay and decline in a broader sense. You can practically hear her thinking about how wonderful things might have been.\nThroughoutTripla, Berenyi appears fully aware of the distance between present and past, and not just lyrically; the music often feels less like a deliberate recreation of the ’90s than a distant memory of the era. “Hurricane” bobs on a Madchester groove, while the marimba that plunks through “Ubique” recalls the exotica-stained sound that Moosepursuedon 1995’sLive a Little Love a Lot. In “A Different Girl,” Berenyi sighs, “My once upon a time is melting in the air,” then promises, “Your once upon a time is coming.” The encouragement is sincere, but it’s hard to ignore the sadness that sweeps over the song’s quasi-bossa nova groove. Deep-space sonar pings pock holes in its surface; big strums from the 12-string rush to fill them. “I never got what I came for,” she adds, a sentiment that hovers over the rest of the song."

    "review_text": "WhenGeorge HarrisonreleasedLiving in the Material World, in 1973, he appeared to be the brightest star among all the solo Beatles. The 1970 triple albumAll Things Must Pass, buoyed atop the charts by “My Sweet Lord,” had finally established him as the full creative equal to his bandmatesJohn LennonandPaul McCartney.Living in the Material World’s lead single, “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)”—Harrison’s second no. 1—appeared to confirm his skills as a hitmaker, but it also hinted at the turmoil that would inform his second album. A line in the chorus— “Give me hope, help me cope/With this heavy load”—sends a ripple of unease running across the song’s sunny surface.\nHarrison’s load weighed a ton when he wrote the bulk of the songs comprisingLiving in the Material World. The blockbuster sales ofAll Things Must Passhad allowed him to launchThe Concert for Bangladesh, a pioneering all-star charity event whose accompanying album took home the Grammy for Album of the Year, but these successes were followed by rapidly escalating headaches. “My Sweet Lord” brought plagiarism charges against Harrison, and the funds generated byThe Concert for Bangladeshbecame embroiled in lawsuits. Harrison’s marriage to Pattie Boyd began to unravel through a series of tawdry infidelities. Looming above it all was the breakup of the Beatles, a contentious, messy affair playing out in courtrooms and boardrooms.\nHarrison details these legal woes in withering detail on “Sue You, Sue Me Blues,” a song whose prominent placement—it’sLiving in the Material World’s second song—suggests the extent to which the singer-songwriter’s troubles shaped the album. (He mentions his former bandmates by name on the title track.) Such specific guideposts counter the spiritual yearning that courses through the record.Living in the Material Worldoften feels caught between extremes that Harrison can’t quite reconcile. The allure of the music speaks to physical pleasure, but Harrison’s lyrics can feel stiff and didactic. His insistence on deliverance through religion can come across as preachy, even hectoring, but the songs can also be interpreted as directives to himself; when he sings “The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord),” he’s not lecturing the audience, he’s trying to center himself at a time of personal uncertainty.\nThe pace throughout is languid and deliberate, giving the album a slightly dour feel. “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)” and “Living in the Material World” provide deceptive notes of brightness at the beginning, and “Don’t Let Me Wait Too Long” and “Try Some, Buy Some” camouflage their tempos with ornate arrangements. But for the most part,Living in the Material Worldrelies on ballads and stately pop performed so slowly that they can be mistaken for dirges."

    "review_text": "It was the spaciousness that madePerceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace,Shabaka Hutchings’ pensive ambient jazz full-length, so remarkable. In all of Shabaka’s previous projects—Sons of Kemet,the Comet Is Coming, andShabaka and the Ancestors—players piled up on top of one another, craggy stones stacked into a towering wall of sound. ForPerceive Its Beauty, Shabaka set aside his hard-edged tenor sax, replacing it with the soft watercolor palette of flute and clarinet. Even on the album’s busier compositions, like the sprawling “I’ll Do Whatever You Want,” or the polyrhythmic groover “Body to Inhabit,” you could hear the distance between each instrument: Shabaka his collaborators reaching transcendence through a different kind of expansiveness.\nThere’s a lot less space onPossession, Shabaka’s follow-up toPerceive Its Beauty, but these dusky songs unfold with equal grace, like an evening primrose blooming. Shabaka’s woodwinds are constantly molting, the tail ends of echoes settling into the fecund humus. Textures fill up the stereo field: Droning chords radiate quietly in the background like the hum of an electrical appliance. Filtered percussion chugs like far-off machinery. The delicate beauty of its predecessor remains, butPossessionis a bit more shadowy. A thin current of anxiety winds through each of its five songs.\nOpener “Timepieces” illustrates this point most explicitly, beginning with a piano that loops over itself like a buffering .gif and distant, doleful moans dipped in reverb. As the drum pattern quivers to life, rapperbilly woodsdescribes the contours of a specific kind of adult heartbreak, one where the formerly entwined can’t ever let go completely. Shabaka’s clarinet shimmies through woods’ syllables, his flute repeats a circular figure, and wordless, choral harmonies add a depth that goes almost unnoticed at first. Though every tone has a rounded edge, woods’ gruff cadence and heartrending lyrics offer a counterbalance; the song exudes the sting of a bittersweet memory.\nThat competing tranquility and tension colors most ofPossession. On “To the Moon,” samples of crickets create the noise floor, over which a digital keyboard’s arrhythmic triggers form a glassy, undulating pad. As Shabaka andAndré 3000whirl around each other, everything melts: Their flutes overlap with a vibraphone, which overlaps with a chiming guitar. A hang drum emerges from the haze, gradually overtaken by a sine wave bassline. During “Reaching Back Towards Eternity,” Shabaka’s plaintive clarinet glides over Nduduzo Makhathini’s spare piano while Surya Botofasina’s synths andCarlos Niño’s wispy percussion deepen the somber mood. There’s an exquisite ache to this music, the juxtaposition of bright autumn foliage against a grey, overcast sky.\n“Timepieces” is the sharpest departure, but all five tracks onPossessiontake Shabaka’s blend of New Age, jazz, and hip-hop further afield, each in a slightly different direction. The songs feel too distinct from one another to be a collection of leftovers or B-sides—though “I’ve Been Listening,” which featuresElucid,Brandee Younger, andEsperanza Spalding, the same crew that producedPerceive Its Beautystandout “Body to Inhabit,” occupies a brighter, more mystical space that doesn’t quite sync with the EP’s uneasy vibe.Possessiondemonstrates Shabaka’s eagerness to tinker with the formula, to explore how his previous maximalism could be applied to the sparser, more internal music he’s been making since returning to the flute. Not all of the noise that surrounds us is deafening, but it’s constant, and perhaps the only way to transform is to fold into the enveloping din."

Her debut, 2020’sThe Baby, was an introspective indie-pop coming-of-age tale from a sharply sardonic point of view, while its follow-up,Honey, zeroed in on the buoyant highs and nihilistic lows of her early 20s.Bloodless, the Minneapolis-based singer-songwriter’s flinty third album, finds solace in scattered confrontations and developing self-realizations. Using deceptively bright folk pop and Americana, Samia crafts an album about coming into your own by tearing yourself apart.\nBloodlessis inspired in part by the inexplicable phenomena ofbovine excision, a favorite subject of conspiracy theorists: Cows, horses, and other livestock have been found mutilated and drained of blood worldwide, with early reports dating back to the 1960s. Using that unsettling image as a metaphor for unsolvable emptiness lends unexpected drama to Samia’s indie pop. Once again working with longtime producers Caleb Wright and Jake Luppen, Samia has evolved her music into a steelier version of her soft-focus early work, just as her lyrics have progressed from bare-bones refrains toward more evocative storytelling. Early highlight “Hole in a Frame,” for example, draws its title from a 1978 incident when Sid Viciouspunched through the wallat Cain’s Ballroom in Tulsa during a chaoticSex Pistolstour, a hole that has since been framed and turned into a tourist attraction; Samia turns the image inside out against a breezyRilo Kiley-style country-folk blend, contemplating the celebration of an absence as a form of self-empowerment.\nSamia’s voice alternates between plainspoken and liltingly melodic, occasionally suggesting doubt and ambivalence. But an edge often enlivens her bittersweet, uneasy lyrics. “I just wanted to be your friend/Cup of tea in your cold hand/And drained, drained bloodless,” she sings in a sprightly tone on “Bovine Excision,” adding depth to the disappointment. Later, her voice is filtered into a stutter on the 2010s pop-rock throwback “Lizard,” where she circles an ex at a party and, seeing herself through his eyes, threatens to set it all on fire. “I didn’t come here to make you look/But intentions are for the guilty,” she sings; “I’m worth my weight in your image/Dancing to something sweet.” In the pinwheeling “Carousel,” she sketches out the specifics of an intimate romance: how much she looks like her lover’s celebrity crushes; she and her lover pretending to sleep in separate beds, to hoodwink her parents. These small, impactful details quickly add up; by the time the song erupts into a beatific crescendo of power chords to match the intense high she feels, Samia is howling right alongside the torrent."

By all accounts it was amemorable night, complete with a dramatic storm that hit during his set—the big screens were lowered, revelers hid in porta-potties, and the rain seemed to drive Richard D. James to play harder and harder music. Eagle-eyed fans noticed something else that night: a new record, stamped with a few logos and the simple titleHouston, TX 12.17.16.\nThe music was ripped and online the next day. The EP—two 10-minute long tracks of scuzzy broken techno that switched gears as often as Meshuggah change keys—was both awe-inspiring and befuddling. The same goes for much ofMusic From the MerchDesk (2016 - 2023), a streaming compilation of the physical releases he’s put out at his shows around the world since then. Some of his strangest and most challenging music is gathered here, in a 38-track, two-and-a-half-hour package that feels both completist and incomplete (his truly avant-gardeMt. Fujicassette is missing), full of goodies for the musically curious but not worth the slog of listening to all the way through.\nNone of the music here is new. There are already countless Reddit threads debating the merits of each release, andMusic From the Merch Deskoffers no bonus material or extras in any form. A handful of these records were already repeats, picking out highlights fromwebstore-only releases, oddities like his inessentialKorg demo 12\", and the famousSoundCloud archive. Another good chunk of the compilation is taken from an LP also known asField Day, after the UK festival James played in 2017, featuring glimpses of brilliance overshadowed by fiddly noodling. For every highlight like the fuzzy, frantic “T20A ede 441”—as hyperactive as something offDrukqs—there’s an aimless experiment or a melody that doesn’t quite land.\nThe rest is hit or miss, with thrilling high points. The Barcelona 12\", never officially released online, is wonderfully wiggly, particularly the psychedelic acid odyssey “rfc pt8.” And theLondon 14.09.201912\", cherry-picking tracks from theonline-only EPOrphans, has the most functional AFX work in decades. Rarely since…I Care Because You Dohas his music been as straightforwardly pretty as his remix of Luke Vibert’s “Spiral Staircase,” which he submitted anonymously to a remix contest—that he won, naturally—in 2004. “Nightmail,” all scorched acid lines and feverish vocal loops, imagines what early AFX might have sounded like if he was steeped in the breakbeat hardcore scene of London rather than tucked away in Cornwall. Best of all is “Soundlab20,” a retro electro track that conjures up James cruising down a beachside parkway in a convertible, with no facial distortions or weird imagery. It’s simply a perfect sunny-day jam, the likes of which he rarely lets loose from his vault.\nTunes like those are worth coming back to, but most ofMusic From the Merch Desksounds like listening to James figure out his equipment in real time, stopping and starting sketches with no discernible rhyme or reason. You might be thinking, “That just sounds like Aphex Twin,” but the material here is more disparate and scattershot than usual—especially sequenced as it is, chronologically according to the release date of each tour EP, with no flow or build-up to speak of. Students of James will find it fascinating, but they’ve probably heard it already. For everyone else, it’s a warts-and-all look at a musical genius in low-pressure mode—another bout of oversharing from an artist who once held his cards close to his chest."

Chengdu rapperjackzebra(Zhang Zheng Kai) raps in an Auto-Tuned slurry that leaves even native Mandarin speakers scratching their heads. His new mixtape,王中王(King of Kings), is a 74-minute, 35-track behemoth with about as many collaborators, drawn from enigmatic sub-1000-follower SoundCloud producer cabals as well as vaunted crews like Surf Gang (Evilgiane,Harto Falion).

But jackzebra is neither Zoomer Jin nor ChineseBladee(as arecent memeput it); if anything, his wispy Auto-Tune draws fromIzaya Tiji.

The impetus for Hino’s new compositional approach here was the 2016 departure of the band’s original drummer, Tetsushi Nishikawa, after which Hino began to explore the metallic textures of Indonesian gamelan and Koreankkwaenggwari, to hypnotic effect. “Throne hh” follows a seemingly erratic sequence of gongs whose structure eludes the ear even as it’s grounded by a ubiquitous friction drum.\nAt the core of their sound remains a stuttering, off-kilter approach to rhythm; you can hear it best in the stop-start chimes of “Orin,” which has echoes in the muted guitar harmonics ofJoy and Fear’s “III I IIII III.” Patiently developing over 10 minutes, “Orin” begins as a rhythmic Rorschach test, with three metallic tones whose relationships to each other morph depending on where you focus your year. Only in the third minute are sporadic bells finally allowed to resonate above the three braiding tones; halfway through, a bell fades in and swells at a regular clip, later joined by a motorik shaker that delineates the pulse. The track is a microcosm of Hiro’s compositional strengths, manipulating the interplay between groove and imbalance.\nThe group’s mimicry of machine precision is no Luddite gimmick. While some might consider goat (jp)’s pursuit of mechanical precision futile, the tics introduced by human performance hint at a physicality that can’t be programmed. “Factory” demonstrates this best, beginning as a monotonous onslaught of clicks that could be mistaken for an overly tight Ableton loop yet gradually revealing minute variations in stress and interval. You can almost feel the carpal tunnel. Even experienced without its choreographed counterpart,Without References / Cindy Van Ackerexudes a physicality that AI plugins and MIDI sequencers have yet to crack."

He got married in the late 2010s, became a father, and settled into home life in Louisville, all of which he commemorated on 2019’s eclecticI Made a Place. That album arrived six years after his last collection of new songs—an eternity for the usually prolific artist—and in retrospect it sounds like a comeback after a handful of odds-and-ends collaborations, covers projects, and conceptual experiments. His new songs were witty and playful, full of shoutouts to Aquaman andThe Little Mermaidand spooning with his lady all night, but he sang them with both gratitude and gravity, as though having so much to be thankful for meant having just as much to lose. His subsequent records revealed an artist rejuvenated, with a new subject and sensibility to boost his collaborations witholdfriendsand hisfollow-up recordwith a crew of local music educators. He made a place—a family, a community—and prospered there.\nSuperficially,The Purple Birdleaves that place. Oldham traipsed south down I-65 to Nashville, where he worked with an outside producer for only the second time in his career. He met David “Ferg” Ferguson 25 years ago when Oldham sang onJohnny Cash’s cover of “I See a Darkness”; Ferg engineered those sessions, and has since helmed albums forSturgill Simpson,Tyler Childers, andJohn Prine. Over the years he and Oldham have grown closer as friends, to the extent that Ferg played at Oldham’s wedding. It seems inevitable, in retrospect, that they would make a record together, but it wasn’t inevitable that they would make such a fine one, Oldham’s best and most focused in some time.\nBefore they even hit record, Ferg told Oldham he didn’t want to make a country album. Instead, he thought they should just make aBonnie “Prince” Billyalbum. Thankfully, they weren’t entirely successful.The Purple Birdis a Bonnie “Prince” Billy country record. Oldham gave himself over fully to the Nashville experience, participating in a series of casual songwriting sessions with various local legends and playing with a wrecking crew of musicians who are deft enough to sound like they’ve been backing him on stages all over creation. There’s a freewheeling spirit to the music they created together, a punchy camaraderie that connects these disparate songs from the agitpolka of “Guns Are for Cowards” to the Celtic dreamfolk of “Downstream,” and from the rambunctious ramble of “Turned to Dust (Rolling On)” to the despairing chorus of “Boise, Idaho” (which contains one of Oldham’s loveliest and most forlorn melodies)."

    "review_text": "Only three sense memories remain from the night my wife and I came home from the hospital after our daughter died, 10 years ago this May. My brother, sleeping like a dog on the couch behind us, a miserable sentinel. The warmth of my wife’s hot tears and breath on my face, inches from my own. And something else, in the background, playing over and over again:Sufjan Stevens’Carrie & Lowell.\nWhy would we do that to ourselves? The album that opens with “Death With Dignity,” the one whose most memorable chorus is a whispered “we’re all gonna die.” And yet I kept returning to the record player, flipping the album over and over. The album functioned as the bleakest kind of prayer, the one that doesn’t even ask for things, just offers a beseeching glance skyward: Notice me. Feel me.\nIn the myopia of my shock and early grief, I barely registered the complicated and brutal autobiographical truth of the record. Yes, it’s an album with a Polaroid on the cover, clearly from a personal collection, paired with two first names. Yes, the lyrics are so specific to one man’s experience as to approach the forensic: “When I was three, three maybe four….” And yet the thumbprint of tragedy, the outline and silhouette of grief, was all I needed fromCarrie & Lowell. I gulped at it, greedily, again and again. My relationship to an album has rarely been more intense. Until this month, I couldn’t bear to put it back on. To me, it had become like a death march, or a funeral mass: music for use.\nButCarrie & Lowell,newlyreissuedbyAsthmatic Kittywith a modest addendum of bonus tracks and a gorgeous 40-page photo album, survives my bloodshot fixation because it is so formally perfect. The arrangements feel inevitable in the way the harmonic motion of a Bach suite feels inevitable. There isn’t a single breath on the album that doesn’t feel drawn with specificity. Play the opening of “Death With Dignity” while staring at a creek, and the rhythms of the opening guitar figure will naturally match up with the flow of the water.\nThere aren’t many artists who can capture and preserve this intimacy and intensity. There is an obvious comparison toElliott Smith, who similarly matched up a shaky and tender vocal with arrangements that felt like you could stare straight through them. But not even Smith bared his soul as directly, simply, and plainly as Stevens does here. Smith was often obfuscating or misdirecting in his lyrics even when it seemed he was confessing, but Stevens lays it all out: times, places, dates, car models. The familiarity that I get from these songs is the same I get from a short story collection rooted in a specific setting—the Nevada of Claire Vaye Watkins’Battleborn, the Wyoming of Annie Proulx’sClose Range. Stevens’ memories become sacred the more granular they become."

    "review_text": "A couple minutes intoThe Undisputed Truth,Drakeo the Rulerasks you to skip backwards through time. “Let’s pretend it’s 2016,” he says, before conjuring images of Mercedes SUVs filled with guns and police officers’ badge numbers disseminated through Instagram DMs. The scene is rendered with Drakeo’s typically chilling wit: he implores the listener to understand that he’s “emotionally scarred” before grinning through his teeth about his enemies ducking behind sedans when they see him coming. The preposterousness is the point. But just as he’s set the action in motion, there’s a pivot in tone: “Oh Lord,” he sighs, suddenly bored by the B-movie climax he’s scripted. “Here go this shit again.”\nThe Undisputed Truthis the second full-length solo album following Drakeo’sassassinationin December 2021. Pulled from the remarkably prolific sessions after his release from jail 13 months prior, the material here is of a piece with the four solo LPs released between his plea deal and eventual death. (During this time Drakeo and his brother, Ralfy the Plug, also recorded a crisp, apocalyptic collaborative album,A Cold Day In Hell.) This final period is marked by a voice more frayed and fried than before, quicker to dissolve into a true whisper, still nimble but evidently burdened. He’d grown more syntactically direct even as his real life became more complex. While the hard drives are reportedly still well-stocked with unreleased songs,The Undisputed Truthfeels like the culmination of what should have been a generational talent’s early-middle period.\nFrom the time he emerged in the mid-2010s, Drakeo showed a keen ability to source beats that both drove toward his own formal aims and could be arranged into starkly coherent projects. At first, this style—dubbed “nervous music”—seemed like the natural extension of what had been happening in Los Angeles rap for the half-decade prior. It took the handmade minimalism of the jerkin’ era—during which Drakeo and his friends earned a little notoriety as dancers—and inverted its playful, pastel energy into something menacing. Its tempos and careening structures evoked rap from Michigan and the Bay Area; the instrumentation echoed the ratchet music that had begun to rattle out of L.A.’s strip clubs. All of which meant that even when a beat located a particularly irresistible bounce, it had a disquieting effect on the listener, making them lean closer to the speaker as Drakeo muttered, in post-post-Suga Free tap dance flows, about the danger he kept clocking in his peripheral vision.\nAfter his release, he made subtle but fascinating tweaks to that sound palette. By the time he was makingSo Cold I Do Em 2, the final record he’d issue while he was alive, a certain iciness had overtaken it; it was as if an extra dimension had been added to the songs, and that dimension was simply dread. And so, while the release dates of that record and this one hold special significance—Drakeo was born on December 1 and liked to drop music as a celebration; now, it is also an unavoidable reminder of his death—he has also, somehow, answered a question too few people had been asking: How can one make the definitive L.A. winter hip-hop album?"

    "review_text": "The first problem is that there aren’t any good songs.Tha Carter VI,Lil Wayne’s 14th studio album—but, given its title, one of the few meant to be instantly canonized—is a blockbuster by design and by committee: No fewer than 28 producers are credited; Bono sings, Lin-Manuel Miranda produces one song. In 19 tracks, there are vanishingly few moments that might prove that this man, still only 42 years old, was once the best rapper on the planet. Songs feel simultaneously tossed off and over-considered; there are perhaps two passages acrossC6’s 67 minutes that scan as anything other than the product of a hyper-competent professional in need of serious creative guidance. It would be a disaster if any of it mattered.\nThe first threeCarterinstallments, released between 2004 and2008, chart Wayne’s rise from “youngest Hot Boy” to the creative and commercial epicenter of hip-hop, his gravity such thatone-offexperimentswould spawn a decade’s worth of imitators. Thefourth, from 2011, sold phenomenally well but came during a sharp artistic downturn following his 2010 incarceration; thefifth, which was finally released in 2018 after years of litigation and leaks, is jagged and messy, but frequently ingenious and idiosyncratic, a master artist bumping up against industry mechanics and his diminished place in culture.Carter VIcomes with no such complications. It is frictionless in every sense: released without a hiccup, seemingly written and recorded in a very expensive vacuum.\nWhich brings us to the album’s second fundamental problem. OnC5, entire songs would be built around a single vocal idea—for example, the clipped, see-saw cadence he applied to the “Special Delivery” flip on “Uproar”—in a way that suggested poise, premeditation, control. Here, nearly every verse defaults to the same dense, superficially complex style: a thick block of syllables cut into words and lines as if it were a jigsaw puzzle. Writing this way can be time-intensive, but requires (or at least reveals) little in the way of actual inspiration; at a certain point, it’s just math.\nIn this way, the useful referent for late-period Wayne is late-periodEminem. Earlier in their careers, both rappers were able to navigate incredibly difficult technical passages while still communicating personality, bend, spontaneity. Today both of them, syllable-obsessed rap nerds that they are, write verses that are—and this is a description, not an endorsement—airtight, scrubbed of any imprecision, but also most of what made them so inimitable at their respective peaks. AtC6’s worst, this dutiful commitment to what is technically correct makes Wayne sound like he’s drowning. On “Flex Up,” his take on aLil Baby-style rolling monotone is intended to cast him as unflappable, but has the opposite effect, leaving him trailing behind the beat, unwilling to break rhythm and catch back up. The chorus of “Banned From NO” is a barrage of rhyming phrases (“The cocaine whiter/The rope chain brighter/The choke chain tighter/The close-range sniper/The dope-game lifer…”) delivered with such sleepy obligation as to become totally uninteresting."

    "review_text": "WhenNels ClinejoinedWilcoin 2004, a prevailing sense of possibility accompanied him. The band, after all, had unexpectedly just broken through with its most obtuse album yet, bending Jeff Tweedy’s plaintive songs through experiments at once electrifying and accessible. Cline, it seemed, would further catalyze Wilco’s adventurous advance. He had been an emphatic power source to the greatGeraldine Fibbersand an essential piece of the ever eccentricBanyan, not to mention a diligent improviser with a résumé that crisscrossedWadada Leo SmithandThurston Moore,Julius HemphillandMike Watt.\nBut during the last two decades, as Wilco has gradually pulled inward and away from those more esoteric textures, Cline has found other contexts for pushing outward—caterwauling guitar-dudejams, struttingtrio sets, even a hauntingfull-lengthalongsidePauline Oliveros. What’s more, his 2009 move to New York made a proper downtown improviser out of him in his 50s; his subsequent albums for Blue Note have not only broadcast those relationships but also framed him as something of a classic jazz guitarist. He started with aset of standards, advanced to athoughtful guitar duo, and then, finally, brandished his wonderfully madcap band on 2020’s dazzlingShare the Wealth.\nPerhaps no Cline project has ever spoken more directly of his range than his latest outfit for Blue Note, the Consentrik Quartet. From the outside, it appears to be an ordinary enough ensemble: a rhythm section countered by guitar and saxophone. All four players, though, arrive at Consentrik with serious bona fides from assorted edges of jazz and new music. Ingrid Laubrock is a daring saxophonist whose works alongside, say,Mary Halvorson andTyshawn Soreyhelped lead to 2020’s brilliantDreamt Twice, Twice Dreamt.She’s played often with the drummer Tom Rainey, a dynamo who can drive the kitanddance with it. The same holds for bassist Chris Lightcap, whose credits stretch from the very pleasant to the absolutely aggressive. On their self-titled debut, written by Cline over the last six years but recorded in just three days last year, Consentrik explore inside and beyond their collective past, moving from dreamy ballads to scrambled bedlam to boisterous grooves and back in a little more than an hour.\nFlexibility unites the members and the material. They are as exquisite on opener “The Returning Angel,” a kind of group deep-breathing exercise, as they are on closer “Time of No Stars,” where they play like longtime friends sharing old stories and finding a sense of calm in the exchange. “Inner Wall,” though, grows into a group growl, the long bass and saxophone tones around Cline’s chiming guitar tightening like a knot just before Rainey arrives; agitation morphs into rebellion, like a great spiritual jazz anthem. What’s most surprising is the audible fun this quartet has digging into or out of a beat, like when they push against a warped clave rhythm during “The 23” or overrun the meter, retreat back toward it, and ultimately let it fall apart in “Question Marks (The Spot).” These are heady players, but they are reveling here in lifetimes of listening, of sharing scattered enthusiasms in real time."

    "review_text": "“I love the silliness and the joy that comes with the P-Funk universe,” multi-instrumentalistEmma-Jean ThackrayrecentlytoldThe Guardian. “It’s not like free jazz; it’s Black liberation music for the masses.” On her second full-length,Weirdo, Thackray’s music—bouncy jazz-funk dusted with spiritual overtones and rubbed down by velveteen ’70s soul—does for grief and loneliness what the Mothership did for Black identity. It uses humor and a shuffling beat to get at something deeply serious, to shape it, to say the unsayable. Its 20 tracks wiggle by in a constantly evolving groove that dares you to stay reverent; you might laugh out loud a few times. Though you will have ample opportunities to try, you will not have more fun empathizing with someone’s suffering this year than you will listening toWeirdo.\nThackray initially intended for the follow-up to 2021’s acclaimedYellowto be a musical exploration of her neurodivergence—a risky proposition for even the most self-aware musician, although for Thackray, a record about her ADHD and autism could well play to her considerable strengths: She writes rhythms that ripple and eddy, and melodies that ping like super balls in a small room. Shortly after she began work, however, her longtime partner unexpectedly passed away, throwing her deep into grief.Weirdobecame her way of pulling herself back out. She recorded the album alone in her South London flat, and, save for cameos fromReggie Wattsand rapperKassa Overall, she’s responsible for every sound on the record: vocal harmonies that spread like a fan unfolding, exhaling Rhodes piano, programmed and live drums, flugelhorns, enough synthesizers to make 1974Herbie Hancockjealous. Her name is listed 123 times in the album’s credits.\nPrinting that surplus of Emma-Jean Thackrays inWeirdo’s liner notes is meant to be a bit, as is the toaster perched on the edge of the tub on the album’s cover. Both are funny, kind of—but, like the dark comedy of the album’s lyrics, the cheekiness is a mask Thackray wants you to notice. “I don’t wanna go on,” she sings in the opening moments of “What is the Point,” a brutal line whose brutality you nearly forget when the squishy synths and curving groove kick in; her vamp on the phrase “what is the point,” later in the song, is clever, but also tragic, but also vocally impressive, but also inspirational: Her runs are so remarkable, you can hear the music bringing her to a place her words can’t."

    "review_text": "Until now,Saya Gray’s projects all shared a similar work-in-progress charm. The titles of her debut LP,19 Masters, and subsequentQWERTYandQWERTY IIEPs read like hastily typed placeholders that never got changed before being sent off to the label. On her second album, the Japanese-Canadian songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist allows her scavenged, fragmented art pop to cohere into something resembling a traditional breakup record. In place of previous releases’ slippery song structures and abstract lyrics,Sayainstead draws intrigue from the complicated figure at its center: Gray can be fussy and prickly or regal and poised, her songs less an exploration of grandiose heartbreak than the quieter disappointment of realizing that the person you thought could handle all of you actually can’t. Which is a shame for them, because to meet Gray on her terms is to hear her make good on the promise of 2023’s “Preying Mantis!”, reiterated here on closing track “Lie Down”: “I can turn your dust into sparkles.”\nIf her older records were abstract-expressionist splatters, each song onSayais more like a Dutch still life, gilded with immaculately detailed grape leaves and oyster shells. Tracks like “How Long Can You Keep Up a Lie?” could even elicit the dreaded C-word—conventional—if not for their thoughtfully applied production touches and Gray’s raw songwriting muscle. Elsewhere on the album, her collagist impulses still flourish, albeit in a more controlled fashion. Beginning as a blocky jazz-pop waltz, “Line Back 22” takes a hard swerve into a breakdown of drums and wordless vocalizing that would fit right in alongsideMeredith Monk’sDolmen MusicorLaurie Anderson’sBig Science.\nIn a bit of transitional magic, the last hiccuping pulse of “Line Back 22” melts seamlessly into “Puddle (Of Me),” one ofSaya’s highest highs and, emotionally, maybe its lowest low. “You know how obsessed I can get/With your needle and thread pulling in and out of me,” Gray sings, nestled in an uncanny valley of backtracked guitars. It’s both a come-on and a capitulation—a little bit sad, a little bit sexy. The pleasure of complete submission, after all, is inseparable from the fear of opening yourself up to hurt. But ever the trickster, Gray flips the script on the lead single, “Shell (Of a Man),” and she’s going to make it sting: “If you don’t like me now, you’re gonna hate me later!” With its jaunty fingerpicking, “Shell” makes for a perfectly twee Trojan Horse, like handing Natalie Portman inGarden Statea microphone, asking her to tell us how shereally feels, then throwing the audio on the film’s Grammy award-winning soundtrack."

    "review_text": "Tobacco City’s version of America smells like diner grease and cheap weed, and it sounds like hope on minimum wage. We’ve all been there, literally or metaphorically, or at least we’ve driven past it in a hurry. It’s the thematic kin of shopping-mall realism like Bobbie Ann Mason’s Coca-Cola laden short stories, where details set like rhinestones place the listener in a particular place and time. It’s not just Andy “Red” PK’s pedal steel or vocal duo Chris Coleslaw and Lexi Goddard’s plaintive twang that makesHorses, the Chicago group’s latest, an effective postcard from the national hinterlands; it’s the transcendental quality of the album’s songs. Tobacco City are blue and surrounded by trash; they are drinking PBRs and determined to find the beauty in it.\nPart of the record’s charm is the businesslike way the vocals pair — no runs, no frills, just harmonies and the assertive charm of veteran storytellers. There’s a marked similarity toEmmylou HarrisandGram Parsons, a twangy, brassy twining without studio bells or whistles. You can hear the desperation and the defiance at once. Coleslaw and Goddard duet the way people sing along to a beloved song with the windows rolled down. “It was always autumn then/summer on the breeze,” Coleslaw sings on opener “Autumn,” between descriptions of hometown characters in various states of trouble. On “Bougainvillea,” he reminisces, “Ain’t it weird when you’re the young one?/Reckless, stupid, and free/You get in the truck and you don’t look back.” Often, these personas are lost in bacchanalia, channeling divinity through mushrooms or wine or love.\nThis transcendence feels most visceral on album standout “Time,” whose sinuous opening gives way to an ambling melody backed by rich, warm instrumentals. The shifts from wailed harmonies to a cyclical, picked riff to the wild chirp of a fiddle sound like a reimagining of a song fromMusic From Big Pink. The eddying instrumentation and the tentative lyrics amble like lovers walking on a summer evening, “watching berries ripen on the vine,” stuck between the frisson of something new and its inevitable decay. “Evening moves in gracefully,” Coleslaw sings, queasily hopeful, “and hovers just beneath divine.”\nOn “Mr. Wine,” a paean to a liquor store run, there are whiffs ofFather John Misty-style drollness until Goddard’s vocals crank the song into its sixth gear. “Bye bye blues,” the pair sing in a jukebox earworm, “Hello Mr. Wine.” There’s nothing winking about the ode to ’70s country cheese, but anyone with sense will be too busy boot-scooting to question the pivot towards goofiness."

Meanwhile, the saxophonist Pulice has become a punk grandchild to the Coltrane-Sanders-Aylerfather-son-holy ghost equation and put out arguablythe best releaseonLongform Editions, no mean feat.\nPhantasy & Reality,the duo’s second full-length collaboration, leans a lot closer to the vision of Avery’s work as Iceblink. Because Pulice has been both boundary-pushing and prolific in the last few years while Avery has released very little, those who’ve followed the former’s career might be surprised by how conventionally lovelyPhantasyis compared to Pulice’s pitch-bent odysseys, like 2022’s Avery-featuringScry. Avery calledCarpet Cocoona “comfort album” to “retreat to during winter,” first putting it out in mid-January 2020 (at the time she lived in Minneapolis, which, unlike the Bay Area, actually haswinter). It’s no coincidencePhantasyappears as the days creep towards the solstice, nor that the sun seems to be almost on the other side of the horizon on the album art: This is a cozy record, to be cherished through the dark months.\nThis time, the reference point isn’t free jazz but the more sedate descendants of that style that emerged on the other side ofMiles Davis’ “He Loved Him Madly” in the ’70s. The 2000s work ofHarold Buddin particular comes to mind, with the call and response between mournful piano and lonesome choir synth on “Moonlight in an Empty Room” uncannily evoking “The Candied Room” from Budd’s 2000 Atlantic debutThe Room,while Pulice’s use of clarinet brings to mind the rosy chamber pieces on Budd’s strongest late-career album,Avalon Sutra.

She’s getting plenty of sleep, going to therapy, hitting yoga four times a week, and being “present with every friend.” You’d never know the heated truth until the song, like its title, cuts behind the scenes. “Honestly? Fuck!” she sings, loosening her voice from its corset, as keyboards fizzle up into the atmosphere and explode like fireworks.\nMorris and singer-songwriter Ryan Hurd, who have a son together, finalized their divorce in January 2024. Later that June, shecame outas bisexual. After she spent portions of her last album, 2022’sHumble Quest, singing about (and co-writing with) Hurd,Dreamsiclecould easily have been a sharp-tongued rebuttal to all that pillowy tenderness. But Morris hasinsistedit isn’t a capital-D divorce album littered with shards, like fellow TexanKacey Musgraves’star-crossed. Instead, it feels closer toMiranda Lambert’sself-inquiryfollowing her 2015 split from Blake Shelton. OnDreamsicle, Morris comes across like a guest attending the house party of her new life, snooping through the medicine cabinet—and catching revealing glimpses of herself in the mirror.\nAmong her discoveries are novel sides to her sexuality. Morris warns a no-strings attachment against developing feelings on the swaying “bed no breakfast,” but the lyrics sound like an awkward Airbnb listing: “A five-star review is expected/I check every box on your checklist,” she sings coyly, backed by breathy, swooning vocals. The more interesting flirtation unfurls with Naomi McPherson (from indie-pop bandMUNA) on the ’80s-inspired “push me over.” Over hair-metal guitar riffs and staggered R&B rhythms, a fitting frame for Morris’ aerodynamic vocals, she details the electric thrill of finally being with a woman. “We can test out my hypothesis,” she demurs.\nMorris has consistently eschewed attempts to categorize her music. But where 2019’sGirlfelt unfocused,Dreamsicleis more cohesive, as though Morris were pulling varied outfits from a single closet. After working with pop powerhouseJack Antonoffon “Get the Hell Out of Here,” off her 2023 EPThe Bridge, she reunites with him for three tracks, including the acrobatic, blues-tinged “people still show up” and the coursing indie-rock closer “holy smoke.” But the complexity of those songs isn’t consistent across the album, and when Morris leans into familiar pop tropes, like the moody synths on “because, of course” or the fairy-dust whimsy of the title track, it feels like she’s following someone else’s style cues, instead of relying on her own instincts.\nWhileDreamsicleavoids too much navel-gazing about the past, Morris is a quick draw on bouncy opener “lemonade,” co-produced bythe Monsters & Strangerzand Isaiah Tejada, taking aim at both her ex and her own habit of trying to sweeten his sour behavior. But she chases the metaphor far past its fencing, landing on the silly jibe, “Gotta pour you down the drain.” The more compelling version of that wounded emotion shines through “this is how a woman leaves,” a country-pop ballad that gives Morris’ voice space to expand into a swaggering snarl.\nIf there’s any love to be found in the wreckage of her marriage, it turns out to be with friends. “grand bouquet,” another Antonoff production, wraps a reflective acoustic guitar around Morris’ quiet delivery as she gratefully acknowledges her friends’ presence in her life. Morris may have once treasured the red roses of romance, but onDreamsicle, she turns her attention to the wildflowers that surround her—and are only now coming into bloom."

From the band’s earliest days, when the project was just Will Toledo recording alone in Virginia, songs were never just as simple as singer and subject—his 2011 albumTwin Fantasywas a romantic epic sheepishly masquerading as a ramshackle emo record. His 2020 recordMaking a Door Less Openwas essentially a treatise on fame itself, and culminated in Toledo adopting the persona “Trait,” a gas-masked, bunny-eared protagonist previously introduced in a Car Seat Headrest side project called 1 Trait Danger. When Car Seat Headrest began teasing their new record,The Scholars, via analternate reality game-style website, it felt like an appropriately elaborate rollout for a band who’s rarely taken reality at face value.\nAnd yet, Toledo was hesitant to dive head-on into the full-scale world-building of a rock opera. To hear him tell it, he seemed afraid that he might stumble into one of the genre’s many pitfalls. “You pull something off ofThe Wall—it’s not necessarily going to be banging on its own. It needs that context,” he told the podcastHow Long Gone. “I like when you can pull a song out and have that individual piece.” It’s a brutal assessment of Pink Floyd, though it comes from a deep respect (the original version ofTwin Fantasy’s “High to Death” interpolated “Jugband Blues,” after all).\nOnThe Scholars, every song aims to be an “Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2”—nine self-contained epics that, Toledo hopes, will sum to a greater whole. But overburdened by a confusing plot, with no room for a listener to digest the bevvy of settings and characters he’s just introduced,The Scholarsis mired in and muddied by the madcap impulses of its creator, drowning out what would otherwise be some of the band’s most inspired, experimental compositions to date.The Scholarsis a rock opera for the playlist era; it wants to contain both a richly textured narrative—with all the character development, internal motivations, and rising and falling action required therein—and also nine songs that can stand alone, plucked out of context and jutted up against whatever other songs happen to land on Spotify’s autoplay.\nSo, the plot:The Scholarstakes us to the imaginary Parnassus University, where we meet a cast of students who are all on parallel searches for meaning: our narrator, the Chanticleer; Beolco, a playwright who’s paranoid his best ideas are behind him: “A thousand ideas piled up in the tomb,” he says on “CCF (I’m Gonna Stay With You)”; Devereaux, the “son of a backwaters religious conservative” who hopes to find higher meaning on the libertine lawns of the American university (“Devereaux”); and Rosa, a medical student who can revive the dead (“Gethsemane”). There is also, of course, a local community based on dressing in furs and feathers (“Lady Gay Approximately”), which I’ll let the Redditors decipher."

    "review_text": "Tim Heckerwould like to show you his reel. During the 2020 pandemic, the veteran power-ambient iconoclast began ramping up his film scoring work. His amorphous combination of distended dronework and analog orchestration began to infect horror films and TV dramas like a hauntedHans Zimmer. Most notably, Hecker conjured a gaggle of deformed miniatures for Brandon Cronenberg’s hallucinogenic sci-fi freak-outInfinity Pool, punk-rock-sized dark ambient bursts where throat-clenching pauses serve as the jump scares. But that’s also him behind the seasick, woozy, creaking sounds for BBC whaling miniseriesThe North Water,the frostbitten gulps of Austrian exorcism dramaLuzifer, and the unnerving dissonance of atmospheric French horror filmLockdown Tower. Glacial and nebulous, Hecker’s heaving soundtracks aren’t as instantly satisfying as, say,Trent Reznor,Daniel Lopatin, orMica Levi’s, but they inhabit a much darker and more mysterious space, delivering a tense, undulating, eldritch surreality all their own.\nHis 12th album,Shards, threads seven pieces left over from these four film projects. Even at a lithe 31 minutes, it serves as Hecker’s most diverse work, an unfixed landscape that moves from shadowy to frigid to transcendent with ease. The song titles and album notes leave no real clues as to which films each track was actually intended for—“Joyride Alternate” is a cool night drive compared to the clank and stomp ofInfinity Pool’sShining-esque “Joy Ride.” Instead,Shardsis a new short film all its own: part sci-fi noir, part android tearjerker.\nRomantic and ominous, opener “Heaven Will Come” isBlade Runnerif scored by Krzysztof Penderecki: a smoky, pulseless electronic fog that builds into a swarm. Textures slurp in reverse, something howls in tune. When the trademark Hecker-ian bass drop makes the entire track rumble with low end, things become at once stranges and more familiar. The gorgeous closer, “Sunshine Key Melt,” is the mirror image, similarly bound in maximal, spectrum-filling sound, but instead producing the type of melancholy shoegaze he was releasing on albums like 2006’sHarmony in Ultraviolet. Twinkling sounds are a pointillist dream; a single piano note falls from the ether.Shardsstarts as Robert Eggers and ends as Terrence Malick.\nIn between lie some of the most unexpected detours of Hecker’s last two decades. The freewheeling mix of tender piano, bustling noises, and something that sounds like a manhandled upright bass on “Morning (Piano Version)” could pass asthe Necksrecording something that could fit on a 7-inch. “Joyride Alternate” pulses like a piece ofCliff Martinez-styled synthwave with some electrostaticky fringes around the edges. For “Monotone 3,” Hecker recruits the same collaborators from 2023’sNo Highs,guitarist Joe Grass (Patrick Watson) on steel guitar and Victor Alibert on uncomfortably close bass clarinet. The track is aTerry Riley-styled minimalist rainstorm; Hecker hovers over it menacingly with some incredibly bleak electronic whine."

    "review_text": "Harold Buddfinally agreed to breakfast. The minimalist composer had been receiving letters from someone named Ruben Garcia insisting that they meet; Garcia thought thatRepetition Repetition, his band with local L.A. guitarist Steve Caton, would interest Budd. He was right: When the three sat down at a Mexican place together, they hit it off immediately and went back to Garcia’s house to jam. Budd collaborated on a few tracks on the duo’s self-titled 1985 debut, plugging one reverb unit into another to make Garcia’s keyboard hover and glide. “They decided at some point that they were interested in art music, rather than dirty club rock’n’roll,” Budd saidin a lectureat the time. “This is going to be difficult, but God help them, I think they’re great.”\nCaton was into “dirty club rock’n’roll” having played in punk bands before hooking up withTori Amos’ early new-wave group Y Kant Tori Read, but he dabbled in jazz and classical as well. Garcia, on the other hand, was fanatically single-minded. “Minimalism is my life,” he said, and meant it. The two found common ground in the work ofPhilip GlassandSteve Reich, which determined the direction of Repetition Repetition: Keyboard figures repeat ad infinitum, while spacious guitar lines swoop and soar. It’s a simple but effective formula that Garcia and Caton put to tape as soon as they began playing together. From 1984 to 1987, they produced the entirety of their discography—three cassettes and two compilation tracks. A selection of these rare songs make upFit for Consequences, which showcases their brief but brilliant evolution.\nThe earliest track here is “Over & Over, Pt. 1,” originally from a 1984 compilation on L.A.’s obscure Trance Port Tapes, which introduces their modus operandi. Garcia’s synthesizer ostinatos create a dizzying, hypnotizing effect that is tempered by Caton’s understated, melancholic guitar washes. This sound wasn’t novel in the mid-’80s—Garcia knew thatTerry Rileyhad gotten there long before, and was fine with that—but Repetition Repetition made it their own with a little lo-fi grit that separated them from capital-M Minimalism. “Apartment Life,” from the 1985 debut, is more pristine, with a gorgeous piano part that anchors chirping tape effects. But even in the song’s meditative drift, Caton’s sparse guitar work maintains a subtle tension. If they wore their influences on their sleeves, they at least had the good taste to tailor them to the underground.\nAfter their first album, Repetition Repetition changed how they worked. Instead of playing together, Garcia would improvise solo in his home studio and then deliver the reels and the 4-track to Caton, who found roughly song-shaped sections to supplement with his own parts. Though the process was more impersonal, it gave each musician a chance to craft their contributions on their own time and on their own terms. “Lakeland” is the most obvious bit ofEnoworship, clearly the work of Garcia, and Caton knows to sit back and just watch its gently rippling piano figures shimmer. On “The Men Are Fighting,” Caton takes charge with overdriven heavy-metal riffs while the keyboard sets a dark, brooding mood. Garcia provides the band’s only lyrics here, delivered in Spanish, describing the life of a machinist working in a factory so that he can continue to make art, “luchando por mi música”—fighting for his music."

    "review_text": "Forty years ago this April,Pet Shop Boysdeclared their M.O.: “We’ve got no future/We’ve got no past/Here today, built to last,” Neil Tennant intoned in the middle eight of “West End Girls” (its first, less successful Bobby Orlando incarnation, before the canonical Stephen Hague version arrived a year later). Currency fuels the British duo’s output, which has never ceased over those four decades, nor attempted to rehash former glories. It’s inevitable that a band that drew in several generations of pop fans would take on a nostalgic hue, but somewhat surprising that Tennant and his foil, Chris Lowe, have leaned into it so intensively in recent years. There have been full-catalogue reissues and a revampedsingles collection; a BBC documentary, a greatest hits tour that spanned three years. They releasedNonetheless, their best album of the 21st century, in April, but only three songs from it made their current setlist; a medley to open the BBC ballroom show “Strictly Come Dancing” last month featured no songs released after 1993 (their cover of Mott the Hoople’s 1972 hit “All the Young Dudes,” from this new deluxe edition of the 2024 album, is the only relative concession to novelty).\nPerhaps this retromania speaks to the difficulty of maintaining attention as musicians aged 65 (Lowe) and 70 (Tennant), a state of invisibility they mourned on 2012’s downbeatElysium. But it feels odd, because the character studies onNonethelessburst with life, their leading men defying cultural norms to chase big dreams—of queer love, self-actualization, promised lands, artistic freedom—and succeeding. Pet Shop Boys even made the album in spite of the pandemic separating them and the future of live music looking iffy: Tennant learned to programme GarageBand and self-record, and they didn’t doubt for a second that gigs would return. Their trilogy of thumping dance records with Stuart Price between 2013 and 2020 had kept them sounding fairly au courant, though byHotspot, Tennant’s lyrical perspective felt resigned. No such state of affairs on the James Ford-producedNonetheless, a return to songwriterly grandeur that glitters with opulence; it’s the most potent swig of Pet Shop Boys’ cocktail of synths and strings in years.\nIn 2018, Tennantsaidthat the diminishing frequency of love songs on Pet Shop Boys albums was because “maybe there’s been less to write about, I’m afraid.”Hotspothad the rather pro forma “Wedding in Berlin,” which interpolated Mendelssohn’s “Wedding March” and repeated, “We’re getting married, married, married,” in a fairly loveless monotone. What a tonic it is to hear Tennant swoon again onNonetheless, admiring Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev fleeing the Soviet Union on “Dancing Star,” which has something of the ocean glitter and exultant mood of 1988’s “Domino Dancing” (not to mention many healthy stabs at the orchestra-stab key by Lowe, its greatest player); giving himself over to someone entirely on the luxuriant “Feel,” likening their time on a terrace to “a Rosetti frieze”; enraptured, amid the smoldering, filigreed bossa nova of “The Secret of Happiness,” by a gent who’s hung Peter Blake’s “Babe Rainbow, framed from the Sunday Times,” on his wall. The worst you can say about these songs is that Tennant’s verses have taken on a bit of a standardized form. Art and love, and devout faith in both, are liberating, protective forces onNonetheless, and Tennant casts his own such origin story alongside this parade of dreamers as proof of concept and another fable ripe for the retelling."

    "review_text": "Much has changed in the five years sinceMichael Kiwanukalast released a record. Against the backdrop of the pandemic and a string of prime ministers passing through his native UK, Kiwanuka has faced tectonic shifts in his personal life. After recording the Mercury prize-winningKiwanukain 2019, the singer finally left London, where he was born and had lived for decades. He also became a father of two, an experience that forced him to develop a steadier hand. “You haven’t got loads of time, so you have to make decisions,” Kiwanuka recently toldThe Guardian. “You have to know who you are.”\nThat sense of equanimity, of calmness in the face of constant flux, lies at the heart ofSmall Changes, co-produced byDanger Mouse(Brian Burton) and Inflo. The record’s vision of psychedelic soul is comparatively spare, almost dainty, beside the sweeping string arrangements and epic gospel harmonies ofLove & HateandKiwanuka. It’s a mellower, more assured album; Kiwanuka seems less interested in topping the charts than in creating a refuge from the noise of modern life, a fixed point around which everything else can continue to spin. Equipped with a more stripped-down palette, he sounds for the first time like a man floating above the world rather than one attempting to struggle through it.\nThe atmosphere is certainly thinner up here. “Floating Parade,” the name of the opening track, could work just as well as a subtitle for the record at large. The songs drift by like so many balloons in a dreamlike procession, buoyed by soft synths and tumbling drums. Spectral background vocals shadow Kiwanuka’s warm baritone through the ether. There’s a koan-like simplicity to the lyrical fragments he breathes like incantations over the album’s spacey arrangements. “Do small changes/Ever last now/Or bemoan in my head?” Kiwanuka sings on the title track.\nIn this placid, downtempo mode, Kiwanuka freely indulges his nostalgia for the sentimentality of ’60s and ’70s soul. A string of unabashedly saccharine love songs forms the record’s backbone. As suggested by titles like “One and Only” and “The Rest of Me,” they trade in starry-eyed schmaltz informed by a youth spent worshipingBill WithersandOtis Redding; they’re full of Hallmark-ready lines like “Young hearts burning/Wherever they take us to/Oh darling, I’m always with you.” But even though the lines may be cliché, Kiwanuka knows how to sell them. Underneath the mawkishness, there’s the wised-up sincerity of someone who no longer cares about sounding cool.\nKiwanuka likewise seems uninterested in forcing anything too spectacular to happen on any of these tunes, as if he looked around at the piles of accolades that followed his last few albums and decided not to risk pulling a muscle. Most songs remain at a simmer. The closest he comes to swinging for the bleachers is with the two-part centerpiece “Lowdown,” which imagines a forlorn Kiwanuka sleepwalking through an alien cityscape, gawked at by locals, ending with an extended instrumental reminiscent of “Shine On You Crazy Diamond.”\nIt sometimes feels like there’s something missing fromSmall Changes. There are few of the bravura solos or transfixing hooks that animated much of Kiwanuka’s recent work. There’s certainly nothing like “Cold Little Heart,” the breathtakingly catchy hit that got snatched up by HBO forBig Little Liessoundtrack fodder and droveLove & Hateto the top of the UK charts. But Kiwanuka seems content to work in an uncharacteristically understated mode, and that’s part of the pleasure ofSmall Changes. It’s a record that gives the impression of an artist knowing who he is—and being happy with what he’s made.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "It’s not that time has been cruel toSalem 66; it feels like it has erased them. Formed in 1981 by guitarist Judy Grunwald (a veteran of a litany of local bands includingthe Maps) and bassist Beth Kaplan with first-time drummer Susan Merriam, the band was representative of Boston’s thriving indie rock scene in the 1980s: one of the original signees to Gerard Cosloy’s Homestead label, Salem 66 played with everyone fromR.E.M.toDinosaur Jr.toFlipper. But for decades after their 1989 breakup, Salem 66’s discography sat untouched, never given a proper digital release, while many of their peers received lavish boxsets and accolades for their continuing influence. Now, with the band’s catalog finally on streaming, an underrated discography finally gets a proper entry point:SALT, a new 10-song primer that draws chronologically from their four studio albums and two EPs.\nFrom day one there was something disorienting about Salem 66. “Across the Sea,” from their only 7\", exemplifies their off-kilter energy: Grunwald’s staccato guitar lines curl like steel wool and Kaplan’s rubber basslines bounce between center and background, their vocals layering but not necessarily harmonizing. “I’m not afraid of living on my own now/I’m not afraid of being far from home,” Kaplan sings with knowing confidence. Salem 66 never sought attention for being one of the few female-fronted bands of their era, but their songwriting ventured beyond the apathy, righteous anger, or puppy love that often seemed to dominate the ’80s underground, like the wife turned vengeful spirit in “Widow’s Walk” or the deeply protective love Grunwald feels for an ex-partner on “Playground.” By this point they had expanded to a quartet with guitarist Robert Wilson Rodriguez, who helped them move beyond scrappy jangle pop to more raucous and driving proto-indie rock.\nSalem 66 refined their sound with each successive release, so it’s slightly frustrating thatSALTis slanted toward the latter half of their career. The compilation truncates their first six years to just five songs, unintentionally presenting the young band jumping between styles as opposed to sinking into its own version of post-punk before expanding further. Admittedly their best material comes from their final two albums,1988’sNatural Disasters, National Treasuresand1990’sDown the Primrose Path. By this point they’d undergone another lineup shift, bringing in guitarist Timothy Condon and drummer James Vincent to push for a bigger, darker sound. The twangy, almost heavy metal riff that opens “Isabella” and the pummeling bassline of “Thaw” demonstrate the creeping influence ofSonic Youthand the slower, uglier sound emanating from the likes of Sub Pop’sGreen River. Grunge was right around the corner, and while Salem 66 were too witty and obtuse to slot neatly into that world, one might have imagined them decamping for the Pacific Northwest and taking up the mantle of a band like the Gits. It was not meant to be, as the band split in ’89 and their legacy faded."

    "review_text": "A hard-to-name pain hauntsTake Off From Mercy, Khari Lucas’ third album asContour.Over rangy neo-soul and psychedelic blues, the Charleston singer and producer considers how a life steeped in suffering can still be heroic, how self-worth can arise from surprising sources. “I give myself my body and my flesh/And what about the heart and mind? Can’t locate them, they’ve long been hidden,” he sings on “Watchword,” his earthy tenor tremoring with a strange blend of sorrow and strength. The speakers in Lucas’ songs seek transcendence, whether through drink or drugs, ambition or romance, religion or death. There are few moments of unmitigated emotional release; Lucas prefers to operate in the haze, his music never soaring too high or sinking too low.\nAs he’s done throughout his catalog, Lucas situatesTake Off From Mercywithin a distinct historical and artistic lineage. His 2022 album,Onwards!, used samples and snippets from films made by the L.A. Rebellion, a collective of Black filmmakers launched in the late 1960s. These archival voices reaffirmed the record’s ethos of resilience and redemption, placingOnwards!within a cross-generational conversation. To help shape the three-act structure ofTake Off From Mercy, Lucas studied Toni Morrison’s novelSong of Solomon. The record’s more obvious influence, however, is what Lucas calls “the itinerant Southern bluesman,” a historical and artistic character he sought to channel during his songwriting process.\nIn the vein of the traveling blues singer, Lucas builds most songs from guitar, an instrument he identifies as a “tool to document your own story and carry on generational tales and traditions.” Working closely with co-producer Omari Jazz, his coiled fingerpicking casts dream-like trances around his plaintive singing. On album opener “If He Changed My Name,” Lucas sings a series of lines whose tone is tough to pin down: “Sell me drugs, sell me drugs, I need them badly/Pleading the crowd, wearing a smile/Some minstrel madness.” Is the Black performer suffering from illness and begging for reprieve, or enacting stereotypes to earn favor and profit? The spare, detail-rich production allows Lucas room to explore such thorny ideas, ambling through verses and breakdowns with the quiet fervor of someone reciting prayers under their breath.\nAt every turn,Take Off From Mercyis dense with meaning, its movements unfolding with subtle shifts of tone or texture. The songs are largely ambivalent to structure, with long-winded verses and the faint promise of a non-existent hook. The power of a song like “Gin Rummy” emerges from its near-imperceptible rising action. Wiry bass and pitched-down percussion clutter around Lucas’ cryptic writing: “Wish I hadn’t lost those letters off my name/For the song that’s left, nobody wants to sing/My voice on its own, not once, but once again.” The tempo slows, the synths cut out, the piano and vocal FX spread wide around the stereo field. After a while, tracks begin to blur and bleed together, becoming a slippery mélange of metaphor and hypnotic repetition. The limitations of Lucas’ voice—which carries traces ofBilal,Dwele, andJames Blake—proves he’s a writer first, singer second. His lyrics are challenging and frequently brilliant; his singing is studious and placid."

    "review_text": "“If there was one thing I wanted to tell them: Good luck. That’s all I could tell ’em.”Damon Locksdoesn’t like to reveal the sources of his samples, but he’s keen to explain this one, from his song “Distance”: It’s the voice of Thelma T., a recently released inmate featured in the 1974 documentaryWomen In Prison. Now she’s free but left with no resources—no job, no connections, nowhere to go. She has nothing to offer the women she’s leaving behind but a wish for good luck. This is a familiar story for Locks, who worked as an art teacher in the Prison + Neighborhood Arts/Education Project at Illinois’s Stateville Prison for over a decade. “Once you see someone’s art, you care about them a little bit more,” hesays. “You’re invested in their internal thoughts, their struggles, their survival. It was important for us to make art on the inside and bring it to the outside.”\nWith his students, Locks wrote the Artist Constitution, a declaration of the incarcerated artists’ beliefs, goals, and demands. The document is the guiding force behind his first widely distributed solo album,List of Demands.“WE BELIEVE Artistic expression is a basic human right,” it states. “WE DEMAND Control over our own narrative.” Locks connects these contemporary calls for change to those from the civil rights movement, putting the present in dialogue with the past through a collage of historical audio from protests, speeches, and interviews. Over it all, he adds his own voice to the constellation of forebears, reciting his poetry in the charismatic cadence he perfected in Rob Mazurek’s Exploding Star Orchestra and the Black Monument Ensemble. The album is less ambitious in scale than those groups, but not in scope—its minimal instrumental loops encompass decades of music, while its unadorned samples contain a multitude of voices. This is not a departure for Locks so much as an arrival, the logical destination of his years as a musician and activist.\nLocks operates in a long lineage of Black spoken-word artists, fromGil Scott-Heronto Dr. Thomas Stanley. In particular, he cites the influence of Linton Kwesi Johnson’s “Making History,” a 1984 song about racist violence and police brutality that resonates all too well today, in light of the protests in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and the global rise of the far right. “Reversed” opensList of Demandswith a bleak description of our current political climate: “We have found ourselves in an impossible situation/The lights are flashing/Colors are clashing/Heads are spinning and it’s just the beginning.” However, reflecting the optimism of “Making History,” “Reversed” predicts the successful resistance of the oppressed. Backed by a swinging piano sample, Locks enunciates each word with the easy assurance of someone who has been in the fight a long time and knows he’ll be in it longer still. The song ends with a sample of someone anticipating the outcome: “The Man is doomed.”"

    "review_text": "It’s hard to hear the opening fretboard squall onMdou Moctar’s 2024 albumFuneral for Justiceand think about how it would sound acoustic. The Nigerien singer and guitarist often writes about the ravages of colonialism in Africa, but he’s always made his deepest points through his instrument as much as his words; he likes to say that he wants his guitar to sound like wailing sirens. This music was never meant to be unplugged, but when a 2023 coup in Niger left three of the four members of his eponymous bandunable to return homefrom New York after a tour, they holed up in a studio and cut a mostly acoustic version of the album in a few days, with bassist Mikey Coltun plugged in. After a month of wondering when they would see their families again, the band members were able to return to Niger.\nTheTears of Injusticesessions were understandably tense, and one imagines Moctar’s feelings of homesickness drove him back to the music of Abdallah ag Oumbadougou. Oumbadougou was part of the generation of wandering ishumar that created the genre variously known as tishoumaren, assouf, or desert blues in the ’80s amid anti-Tuareg persecution in Mali and Niger, including bans on such music. Though compared to Moctar’s fiery virtuosity his sound was restrained, he inspired a young Moctar to build his own electric guitar in spite of his parents’ religious restrictions on music. The arrangements onTears of Injusticeskew closer to that style than the rock’n’roll onFuneral for Justice,and it’s poignant to think of the sad circumstances ofTears’creation leading the artist to seek out the sounds of his youth.\nMoctar has suggested that as opposed to the “anger” the electric arrangements onTearsexpressed, this music reflects the “grief” of the people of Niger, whose uranium resources are still being exploited by former colonial occupier France more than 60 years after independence. It’s a duality so obvious as to be cliché—loud music is angry, quiet music is sad—but it’s powerful when you consider Moctar is performing the exact same sequence of music, implying that both the anger and grief were already present. Moctar’s idea of the song as a durable structure whose meaning depends on how it’s played carries through to his jam-heavy shows and even his studio albums, often edited by Coltun from hours of improvisation. “OnFuneral for Justice, we tried to give all our energy to make it fast and get everyone to dance,” Moctar has stated. “Here, we want you to listen and understand everything I’m saying.”"

    "review_text": "Harto Falión’s life isn’t just a movie. According toThe Hurtless, his new collaborative album with in-demand cloud rap producer and fellowSurf GangaffiliateEvilgiane, it’s also a cartoon and a video game: anything but real. Formerly known as Trip Dixon, Falión is something of a scene veteran, coming up in the mid-2010s alongside emo rap pioneers likeBlack Kray,Kirblagoop, andLil Tracy, primarily as a producer of sinister, grime-caked trap beats. With that wave long past, he’s found a place and a new moniker among the disaffected underground upstarts who’ve kept the mumbled, somnambulant sound ofGoth Moneyen vogue. His excellent beat selection and taste in graphic design that could be mistaken for anNBA Streetloading screen or MTV2 bumper puts him in convincing company with vanguardists likeXaviersobasedandPolo Perks, though Falión’s songwriting lacks the distinct personality that makes their work compelling. ThroughoutThe Hurtless, his expressions of detachment and dissociation are as hollow as the feelings themselves. Listening to the brief 20-minute tape feels like visiting a national park via VR headset, surrounded by beauty while still breathing the stale air of your bedroom.\nFalión’s vocal textures are an ideal match for Evilgiane’s vaporous, meditative production, which dabbles in vintage downtempo ambiance and the skeletal trappings of ’80s minimal wave. Falión backs his lilting delivery with a chorus of multi-tracked hums and moans, which easily melt into lovely keyboard arpeggios that sound like they’ve been lifted from earlyµ-Ziq. Their synergy is strongest on tracks like “Un Love Able,” when Evilgiane takes the lead, emphasizing bouncy melodies and a bitcrushed flute while Falión phases in and out of focus. On “An Innermission Conducted by Eli & Giane,” he eschews rapping entirely to weave a sort of cyborg Gregorian chant over squelching arpeggios. Though billed as an interlude, the track is one ofThe Hurtless’ most complete offerings. Falión’s wordless presence takes on a mystic quality, echoing through a twisty, cavernous beat. Distorted flecks of digital percussion sound like they’re dripping from stalactites: the sense of isolation and disembodiment is all-consuming.\nThe Hurtlesssucceeds at creating a desolate atmosphere. Falión’s writing doesn’t quite meet the moment, often merely asserting the album’s themes without fleshing out the finer details. On multiple tracks, he describes his life as if he’s watching it unfold onscreen; it’s tough to listen to lines like, “[T]hey told me life is just a game, so why you acting like a noob? You better level up, you know my team is OP,” without being reminded ofTikTokswinkingly lip-synced to Falling in Reverse’s “Game Over.” The title of the drum’n’bass-infused “Like Lain” suggests an exploration of cyberculture and identity inspired by the 1998 anime cult classicSerial Experiments Lain,but the series isn’t even referenced in the lyrics—it’s just another media-centric signifier. When he does offer sensory information to process, describing how he’s “so hungry for this shit [he’s] gnawing off [his] cuticles” on “Don’t Believe ’Em,” or crafting absurd flexes like “the Tris giving me expensive belches,”The Hurtless’ world feels much more lived-in. There’s a fragile beauty on the record’s surface, but the emptiness beneath veers into the uncanny valley."

To hear the Canadian sound artist discuss her instruments is to marvel at the way technology can channel both the cultural and the personal. The pipe organ she played growing up in church is more than just shorthand for the holy; it’s the original synthesizer, a tool for Coverdale to recreate voices bothhumanandnonhuman, depending on which reed stop she uses. When she was 10, a crude boom box with an artificial bass-boost function taught her about dubbing tracks, and that remixing could be a creative act in itself. The piano’s damper pedal,she has explained, freed the hand from the constraints of the keyboard and opened up a world of expression. “Anything can have a voice,” she says in the announcement forFrom Where You Came, her first album in eight years. “For me, voice is beyond human.”\nThis studied attention to detail has led to a body of work where sounds are rich with complexity, their emotions uncertain and in between.

The synth clusters of “Flickers in the Air of Night” swell and swirl against Anne Bourne’s cello, rising like steam from a hot spring. The contrast of cold and warmth is no accident.From Where You Cameplays like a tribute to the cold winters and wooded lakes of her upbringing in the rural Ontario community of Valens, where family tradition paired ice-water plunges with hot saunas. Rather than diving into the subtleties of her music’s textures, however, Coverdale often hovers just at the edge of them, passively observing until they dissipate into thin air.\nCoverdale seems stuck between wanting to develop her tracks into full-fledged songs and making them mesmerizing enough that you surrender to the drift. “Daze,” one of the album’s strongest moments, weaves its mellotron-esque melodies around each other like birds dancing through the sky, picking up heft as a bassy low end kicks in. It feels like it might be going somewhere epic, but ultimately ends up noodling about for the song’s remaining minutes; repetition pushes past meditation and into lethargy. The seven-minute cruiser “Freedom” sets up potentially interesting contrasts as horns billow against a buzzing sound like digital cicadas, but by the end it doesn’t reveal much beyond a glazed sense of cheeriness. Less than two minutes long, “Coming Around” fits more ideas into a much shorter span, growing from a downtrodden murmur of keys into an aching melody that suggests sprites warbling up at the stars."

    "review_text": "Sarah Mary Chadwick’s music is often a difficult listen, but that’s the whole point. Throughout her career she’s dealt with heavy subjects, including the death of her father and her own suicide attempts, delivering every line with blunt honesty. It’s a style consistent with other modern-day eccentrics likeJoanna SternbergandSt. Lenox, artists who update and refine the so-called outsider singer-songwriter music ofDaniel Johnston. So intimate is Chadwick’s style that it can sound almost as if she’s making up the songs as she goes along, simply setting her internal monologue to music, whether she’s playing an 147-year-old organ on 2019’sThe Queen Who Stole the Skyor embracing lush chamber pop on 2020’sPlease Daddyand 2023’sMessages to God.\nMostly, Chadwick sticks to her main instrument, the piano. On this album,Take Me Out to a Bar / What Am I, Gatsby?,she strips back as far as she can go, to just stark block chords and the occasional glissando. Engineer Chris Townend recorded the piano with contact mics, which pick up sound from direct physical vibrations rather than from the air. Once recording was complete, Townend played the entire thing back while holding down the sustain pedal, capturing the sound of the piano resonances and layering them into the mix. That simple choice gives the album the scale of Chadwick’s more ornate records. Even as she’s pushed back on the descriptor “raw” (“There’s a lot of craft in what I do,” shetold Bandcamp in 2019), this record’s rawness is an aesthetic choice, not a default. If the video forPlease Daddysingle “When Will Death Come” suggestedAmélie-esque whimsy, with golden lighting and sprightly choreography, this new music is willfully monochromatic, leaving us with just her scratchy alto.\nAbout that alto: Though the songs are better structured, Chadwick’s singing is less polished, with loose vocal doubles and frequent voice cracks. Seconds into “What Am I, Gatsby,” she sings, “Request a song right now/And I’ll sing it from the he-a-a-art,” deliberately and cheekily off-key. Other off-key moments feel like a natural outcome of the raspier singing style. As evidenced by her discography, she could write more conventional songs and sing them well, but that’s not what this album is for. Instead, it feels like one more exorcism of her demons before learning to coexist with them.\nIt’s genuinely unusual to see Chadwick looking up, even if she nestles that optimism within a song characterizing Life as a chronic abuser. “I’m Not Clinging to Life” is suitably morbid, but there’s an old-fashioned folk lilt to the melody. She sings about accepting hardship instead of wallowing in it: “I have lots of fun things/Planned to make up for how/He mistreated me badly/From birth until now.” Somehow, it’s one of the more optimistic songs she’s made. That resilience resurfaces on “The Show Musn’t Go On” and “She Never Leant Upon a Bar,” two songs where Chadwick knowingly stops short of her darkest material. In “The Show Musn’t Go On,” she departs a bar before the night goes sideways, reminding herself, “It’s fine for me to take a little time to feel good.” Once again, it’s a message with personal implications: By the time of the album’s release, she was sober and adapting to a new diagnosis of Bipolar II, milestonesshe sharedon social media.Gatsby, then, is the sound of someone learning to want to live.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Sleep Tokenmight be the biggest metal band in a generation. Since their breakthrough 2023 album,Take Me Back to Eden, the masked, anonymous UK quartet has rocketed from midsize clubs to headlining major rock festivals. They have twice as many Spotify monthly listeners asTool, a good enough antecedent for Sleep Token’s melodic and progressive sound. Their fall 2025 arena tour sold out in mere days. On May 9, they released their fourth album and first for RCA,Even in Arcadia, which isprojectedto land at No. 1 on theBillboard200—a near-unprecedented feat for a band with metalcore origins.\nButEven in Arcadiais a metal album made by musicians who appear petrified of metal’s fundamental pleasures—screams, breakdowns, violence, riffs, exhilaration, exaltation. Instead, Sleep Token’s major-label debut mostly offers sanitized pop-rap with all the sexed-up verve of Droopy the dog. Their bumbling composite of generic pop and trendy metalcore is both schmaltzy and dull: a vacant wasteland where joy, excitement, and intrigue—sensations that all good metal and pop should evoke—go to die.\nMuch of Sleep Token’s confoundingly broad appeal hinges on their shtick. Their singer-songwriter, mononymously known as Vessel, hasn’t given an interview since 2018, refuses to speak onstage, and keeps his face painted black and concealed behind his mask. The band begins every Instagram caption with “behold,” refers to its singles as “offerings,” and calls live shows “rituals.” To many, this makes Sleep Token a magical enigma. To me, this is dumb as hell.\nPrevious Sleep Token albums were more firmly grounded in djent, a style of rhythmic metal characterized by polymetric chugs played on downtuned eight-string guitars. Djent was pioneered at the turn of the century by Swedish extreme-metal scientistsMeshuggah, then exploded in popularity worldwide in the early 2010s. Sleep Token aren’t so much innovating the form as they are plundering and prettifying artifacts from djent’s creative peak in 2013.Even in Arcadia’s sporadic metal sections can be traced back toNorthlane’s cryptic post-metal djent,Issues’ rap-infused nu-djent, andAfter the Burial’s brutally groovy prog-djent. The difference is that Sleep Token’s approach is sleeker, softer, and more overtly commercial—an embodiment of the way the once progressive sub-style has become, well, djentrified for mass consumption in the 2020s.\nPick any one of their arena-metal predecessors, and Sleep Token’s output rings hollow by comparison. At leastLinkin Park, as irredeemably corny as they became, could translate genuine pathos with undeniable shout-alongs like “Numb” and “In the End.” At leastSlipknot’s biggestradiostaplesretained the band’s tortured disposition. EvenMetallica’s most commercial gambits,LoadandReload, had songs that fucking rocked. Sleep Token never let themselves rock onEven in Arcadia. Sex and violence are only ever suggested, never displayed. The metal elements are so superficial, forced, and uninspired that they recall a college student doing volunteer work solely to pad their resume."

    "review_text": "The first and only time thatKali Malonesat down for a lesson on the pipe organ, she managed about five minutes at the console before begging her teacher to take her inside the belly of the beast. That desire is borne out in her music: Listening to her expansive, slowly moving compositions, which bristle with dazzling arrays of layered waveforms, you feel like you are not just inside the organ—pressed against its pipes, vibrations coursing through your body, air whisking over your skin—but enveloped in the sound itself. The simplest interval might throb like an outboard engine, every new chord triggering wave after rippling wave of beating effects, vibrations as pronounced as the ridges and grooves of corrugated metal. Malone oncesaidthat drone composerÉliane Radigue“tunes the listener’s attention to a place somewhere between committed focus and surrendered consciousness,” and the same goes for her own music. Malone’s patient, cycling melodies suggest spiritual contemplation, yet their immense physicality is monolithic, monumental, mind-emptying.\nOriginally released in 2019,The Sacrificial Codewas Malone’s breakout album, following a run of records—drone meditations for electric guitars, electronics, strings, gongs, and wind instruments—that the American-born musician recorded after moving to Stockholm, where she studied alternative tuning systems and threw herself into the city’s experimental music scene.The Sacrificial Codesoon established a cult following, perhaps in part because its dissociative repetitions felt particularly suited to the mood of enforced stasis that landed like an anvil in March 2020.\nThe album paved the way for a series of acclaimed works that would demonstrate the full range of Malone’s talents:Living Torch, a multi-channel piece for bass clarinet, trombone, and ARP 2500 synthesizer;Does Spring Hide Its Joy, a three-hour drone epic recorded during the doldrums of lockdown with cellistLucy RailtonandSunn O)))guitaristStephen O’Malley; and last year’sAll Life Long, a suite of interwoven pieces for pipe organ, brass ensemble, and chamber choir. That material, which Malone and her players have performed extensively over the past couple of years, represents her most compositionally ambitious work to date. But a new reissue ofThe Sacrificial Codeoffers the chance to revisit a pivotal moment in Malone’s artistic development, when ideas that might seem principally formalist—about early-modern musical forms and arcane tuning systems—came together in an album charged with unusually powerful emotional resonance. In its bracing purity and focused intent, it remains a high-water mark in her catalog."

    "review_text": "To really, deeply understandRauw Alejandro’s new album, it’s key to brush up on the sensuality, palatability, and enduring popularity ofsalsa romántica. The softer Latin Pop-adjacent version of what some call “salsa gorda”—which predominated in the ’70s, focused on instrumental improvisation, and was notably more political than its counterpart—focuses on big themes: love, sex, parties. Years later, reggaeton, and its top-charting artists, wouldfollow a similar trajectory.\nAfter an immersive jaunt to the future in cyberpunk-codedSaturno, the Puerto Rican playboy places his feet back on terra firma. Named for a ’69 Fania classic by salsa Neoyorquina greatsWillie Colón and Héctor Lavoe,Cosa Nuestraclocks in at just over an hour where Alejandro pays conceptual homage to salsa with a grandiose audiovisual proposal. El Gran Combo de Rauw Alejandro is in full force in the title track, introducing the record with a recreation of genre cornerstone “Qué Lío.” Complete with congas, piano, and the hum of upright bass, it’s an ambitious invocation that sets you up for something refreshingly different.\nThe tragedy ofCosa Nuestrais not that it’s a false promise, but that it’s inconsistent. For every moment Rauw delivers mature artistry, there’s a throwaway. The neo-merengue of “Mil Mujeres” grows until it explodes into breakbeat. Bad Bunny collab “Que Pasaría…” is fun, but leaves you wondering what would have happened if they tried to make something more than chart reggaeton. “Déjame Entrar,” whose accompanying video isone of Rauw’s most luxe, seduces over Mag’s slinky production as it moves between slow percussion, booming dembow, and fast guitar. The other singles, “Touching the Sky” and “Pasaporte,” are noxiously anodyne pop.It’s almost surprising to see Alejandro play it so squeaky-clean knowing he can push the mainstream forward if he wanted to.\nThe best moments onCosa Nuestrachannel the musical giants from Borinkén and beyond. Those of us who were gagged at his candlelit rendition ofLaura Pausini’s 1994 smash “Se Fue”at last year’s Latin Grammys will be pleased to see it here, complete with soaring electric guitar. Alexis y Fido-assisted “Baja Pa’ Aca’” gives a masterclass in smutty harpsichord-driven perreoIvy Queenherself would throw it back to. WithCosa Nuestra’s whole thing being bringing the past to the present, it raises the question: Where the hell is the salsa?\nAside from a conga or timbales here and there, the classic genre is sadly relegated to an aesthetic motif. What could have been a powerful moment of reinvention, experimentation, and reverence comes off as simple ornamentation. The only moment Rauw wholeheartedly gets into it is a cover of Frankie Ruiz’s salsa romántica classic “Tú Con Él,” a fan-favorite sincehe played it at Global Citizen Festival. He sounds great and the tribute works, but the effect is the same asRihanna’s Tame Impala karaokeonANTI."

    "review_text": "In 2018,Naofound a fun metaphor for reinvention in Saturn’s return, the astrological notion that every three decades, people undergo radical personal transformation. The London singer, then 30, had made her name as a prophetess of synth funk, teaming up with electronic producers likeDisclosure,A.K. Paul, andMura Masafor retrofuturist cuts full of liquid basslines and deep grooves. OnSaturn, she traded the dense funk for ventilated R&B that spanned Afropop, neo-soul, and quiet storm. The looser arrangements, full of space, centered her striking and nimble voice, which can ascend to the heavens or rumble in her throat.\nLiteral space became one of her primary lyrical devices on that album, dilating her tales of romance and heartbreak into cosmic epics about the pleasures of proximity and the pains of distance. She returns to that stargazing mode onJupiter, which she’s called the “sister album” toSaturn. But the writing and performances lack the luster of her previous work, and are sometimes noticeably derivative and muddled. Where her past records confidently navigated the many strains of past and present R&B that inform her style,Jupiteris adrift.\nThe album has a light theme of healing and gratitude. Nao spent six months in Los Angeles recording it, a change of environment that helped her recover from a debilitating autoimmune disease. Channeling that experience, she spends the record spreading sunny vibes and domestic cheer over warm melodies and swaying rhythms. The mood is pleasant but anonymous. “Living like happy people/Living a life more peaceful,” she sings on the upbeat “Happy People,” espousing a vague vacation idyll. “Know I’m all in with my friends/’Cause we make it in the end,” she chants on the highlife-inspired “We All Win.” Who iswe? The end of what? Peek beneath the rosy surface of the songs, and there’s often no substance to the bliss.\nThat’s especially true when Nao leans into cosmic imagery, which has become a crutch. While she nails “Light Years,” a space-themed ballad with a soaring hook that builds to a fireworks pop of synths, the conceit more often produces clunkers. “Closer when we’re far apart like/Milky Ways and hazy stars,” she says of an estranged loved one on “Better Days.” On the title track, love launches her “somewhere in the sky above Jupiter/Like I don’t ever wanna come back to Earth,” a distance that sounds more like teleportation. Hyperbolic analogies are a staple of R&B, a genre smitten with stormclouds and rainfall. But these devices tend to muddle Nao’s ideas. Instead of big and powerful, her emotions feel indistinct.\nMany of the more grounded songs also fail to launch. The playful nu-disco of “Poolside” aims for steamy fun with the awkward come-on, “Come play in my poolside.” (Inthe poolside?) “Just Dive” seems to encourage risk-taking and conquering fears, until the aquatic imagery gets confusingly mythological: “We could be like mermaids, keep it twilight,” Nao says of, um, taking a plunge. Her supple singing and the lively production keepJupiterfrom being a slog, but the hazy symbolism sours the experience.\nIt’s telling that “All of Me,” the one song not mired in metaphor, is the record’s most affecting. Floating over bass kicks and hi-hat flutters, Nao spells out her fantasies as she scales her register. “All of me on you,” she purrs on the pitched-up hook, oozing desire. It’s one of the few lines onJupiterthat thinks of space not as a setting or state of mind, but as a relation between bodies—one that’s being negotiated, in real time, on a dinky little planet called Earth."

    "review_text": "OnSend a Prayer My Way,Julien Bakerand Mackenzie Scott, who performs asTorres, are falling off the wagon and staring at its wheels; they’re reckoning with regret; they’re wrestling hateful mothers. Longtime listeners of the two artists know that they often lay their struggles at the forefront of their music, from prying at religion to coming to terms with queerness to looking up from a bottle’s bottom.\nBut here, they come at these themes from a new angle. About five years ago, Scott floated the concept of a country record to Baker, a laWillie Nelsonand Waylon Jennings—and was surprised when she said yes. “I was worried that Julien would say no, and I cannot stand rejection,”Scott toldGarden & Gun. “So I framed it as, ‘Wouldn’t that be hilarious if we made a country record?’ And Julien was like, ‘Oh, hell yeah, I’m gonna send you some demos.’”\nCountry music played a formative role in both singers’ lives: Scott grew up in Georgia, surrounded by church music and ’90s country; Baker grew up in Tennessee on a steady diet of Merle Haggard and George Jones. (You can check out the duo’s“Cuntry” playliststo see some lasting favorites.) But for the length of their respective careers, they’ve stuck to the rock/indie nexus.\nSend a Prayer My Way, the result of their country collaboration, is an examination of religion, drugs, and love set in working-class Southern neighborhoods—both a tribute to their upbringings and an effort to reimagine the genre. At times, the blend of their individual rock styles with country creates something fresh, but some efforts feel more pastiche than inventive.\nThe album’s obsessed with love, in every iteration—and how much you can make peace with it. Scott opens “Tuesday,” a slow-moving and tender paean to the titular woman, with adoration. But as the song reveals itself to be about queer desire, it also reveals the challenges its narrator faces: the hateful response from her crush’s mother and the mournful self-excoriation that results, all grounded by Baker’s accompaniment on a resonantdobro. “Sugar in the Tank,” meanwhile, is nothing if not self-assured. As Baker repeats “I love you” at the start of each line, underscored by banjo and a Hammond organ, the song ramps up in passion, insistent and rollicking. When it breaks into the chorus, the pair’s voices come together, their twangy vocals layering in an earnest and honest country-pop element with tongue-in-cheek sultriness (“Put a little sugar in the tank,” anod to queerness too) that cools down cleanly on “I’ll love you all the way.” They thread classic imagery beside the love declarations: They’re “tied up on the train tracks,” “strung out on the drying rack,” and “sitting outside with the engine runnin’.”"

    "review_text": "In the first half of the 2010s, artists likeShy Glizzy,Fat Trel, and Lightshow steered DC metro area youth toward homegrown rap, though their sound mirrored much of what was happening in Southern rap nationally. Somewhere around 2015, kids who’d come of age during those pioneering acts’ ascension began developing a style that felt distinctive to the DMV. It’s a shift that can’t be fully understood withoutSparkheem. Alongside beatmakers like Cheecho and Dolan Beats, he distinguished the sound of local street music in the mid-to-late 2010s with ominous keys, interpretations of DC’s go-go drum patterns, and a barrage of sound effects that created an atmosphere of playfulness and gloom. Sparkeem’s contribution to that formation is singular, though. More than his contemporaries, he’s cultivated a presence in just about every micro-scene within the larger DMV underground.\nThe organ he incorporated intoQ Da Fool’s 2017 track “Backyard” feels like a direct descendant of the churchinessZaytovenfedGucci Mane’s early trap confessionals. The mystic synths he administered on Lil Xelly’s 2018 single “BBQ” creep behind the quintessential skipping hi-hats. In 2019, forLil Gray—a rapper who inspires Sparkheem’s most adventurous production—he flipped an early 2000s jingle for Maryland car dealership Eastern Motors into something you’d hear at the club. His broad reach in and outside the local scene made Sparkheem and his production partners Mannyvelli and Spizzledoe attractive to Maryland-raised R&B superstarBrent Faiyaz, who brought the three to his ISO Supremacy label. Soon after, Sparkheem contributed toTommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby,” one of the biggest hits of last year.\nWith a 4x platinum record under his belt, the producer releasesNow That’s What I Call Crank! 25, a 23-track mixtape co-billed with An1 that reflects Sparkheem’s shine back onto the present-day DMV rap landscape. Since 2019, Sparkheem has dropped five projects similarly reminiscent of physical DJ mixtapes, each acting as a survey of the local scene’s evolution—a census of newcomers and mainstays alike. This one starts with an unheard track from the late PG County rapperGoonew, whose delivery and staggered flow made it all the wayto Francebefore he was killed in 2022. Titled “Start My Day,” it flips, decelerates, and adds choppy drums to the instrumental fromBritney Spears’ “Toxic” beneath Goonew’s signature whisper.\nNow That’s What I Call Crank! 25bridges two related yet distinct eras of DMV underground rap. When Sparkheem rose to prominence in the 2010s, many of the scene’s most popular artists achieved virality by finding pockets within the beats of popular songs from their childhood that hadn’t yet been mined for samples. That was the Crank era. Sparkheem captures it on “Like Dat,” which recruits Landover, Maryland’sXanman(aka Xanservin) and, like Xan’s best work, joins the sensibilities of 2000s R&B with the cadence of a contemporary rap singer. Here, between sweet promises of Palm Angel outfits and hazy nights out, Xan interpolates the hook fromLaila!’s “Like That!” On “Do Not Enter,” Sparkheem chops up the beat from Trick Daddy’s 2001 hit “I’m a Thug” while Lil Gray and DC’s CartiEars cram as many words as possible into bars about living on the edge. As with Goonew on “Start My Day,” Sparkheem offers these tracks as quintessential Crank records, presenting DMV reimaginings of widely known pop songs."

    "review_text": "Over the past two decades,Animal Collectiveand its members have produced at least half a dozen albums widely hailed as masterpieces. But what makes AnCo feel so much like a Great Band isn’t just those records—it’s the array of one-offs, collaborations, soundtracks, and idle experiments released between the classics. Every release isn’t guaranteed to blow your mind, or even be especially listenable (take, for example,Avey Tare’sentirely-backwards collaborationwithKría Brekkanor the ear-piercing buzz ofDanse Manatee, which might sound unfriendly at first). Instead, Animal Collective’s appeal lies in how they’ve staked out an oasis of aspirational strangeness where anything can happen, and the usual expectations for a critically acclaimed indie rock band need not apply.\nIn that context, considerA Shaw Deal,an album Animal Collective’sGeologistmade with his friend Doug Shaw ofHighlife. Its runtime is less than half an hour, and Geologist, aka Brian Weitz, made it as a gift for Shaw’s birthday; still, given its place within the larger AnCo constellation, perhaps it’s not especially odd that the album got a proper release with a label and PR campaign and everything. You suspect this is the kind of thing people in AnCo-land make all the time: These guys live and breathe art, and in a cultural dark age where A.I. threatens to render artistic intent an old-fashioned concept, there’s something kind of noble about how much effort went into an album that’s basically an inside joke.\nGeologist made these seven tracks by taking guitar recordings Shaw posted on Instagram during the pandemic andrunning themthrough his modular system until it spat out tangles of sound. The acoustic guitar has long been associated with a certain ideal of authenticity, of not needing fancy tech to get your feelings across. Here, that idea goes delightfully out the window. In Geologist’s hands, Shaw’s acoustic guitar sounds like a million other things while still resolutely sounding like itself, its notes sliding from one to another in big, oblong blocks rather than sounding plucked or strummed. “Petticoat” begins in similar territory to the West African-inspired pop doodles on Highlife’s 2010 EPBest Bless. But by the end of the track, its sound evokes a set of rubber chickens being played like a drum kit. On “Ripper Called” Shaw’s guitar could be mistaken for a squabble between woodwinds, before we hear what sounds like a giant sleeping bag being unzipped from the inside. “Route 9 Falls” splinters a fingerpicked snippet into a cascade of notes that suggests standing beneath a waterfall in the freezing cold. It’s abrasive in a purifying way."

From the sultry R&B that initially defined her style to the high-octane, baile funk-infused sounds permeating her latest album,DRY CRY,the west end native draws inspiration from the sticky, sold-out venues and adventurous DJs of the city’s party underground. Paired with her emotionally charged lyricism and cocky, assertive delivery, her music reflects the ongoing relationship between the rap, R&B, and electronic scenes—particularly the expansive possibilities posed by experimental and electronic Caribbean music. She joins a rising wave of young Caribbean artists, DJs, and producers from Toronto, like previous collaboratorsBAMBIIandJordior, who are bending the boundaries of what Caribbean music can be. OnDRY CRY, she skillfully maneuvers between scenes, all while representing her roots as a westside (and West Indian) Toronto ting.\nSadBoi hails from a Caribbean household and she laces her heritage tightly throughoutDRY CRY,whether it be the seductively stripped-back island acoustics of “nana” or the Black Toronto lingo and Jamaican patois (including her signature “you dun know” tag) that punctuate her lyrics. A city of mass immigration with a heavy West Indian influence, Toronto is a hybrid scene of cultural exchange and exploration, and SadBoi’s Afro-Brazilian influences trace her distinctive lane. OnDRY CRY, she builds on the foundation laid by her previous album,Bare Chat, and doubles down on her commitment to the uniquely erratic rhythms of baile funk, combining its cymbals and bass with the sweet sensuality of this past summer’s “sexy drill” wave.\nHer flair for exploration is intentionally front and center onDRY CRY. Thunderous staccato kicks blend with bell-like metallic accents on “Rosa” and “Cunty”—featuring Paulistano producer DJ SAZE and Bahian rapper Duquesa, respectively—for a hemisphere-spanning sound that folds in both the raw dancehall inflections that reflect SadBoi’s Jamaican heritage and the elements of soundsystem culture present in Brazilian funk’s origins. Standout singles “Baddies” and “Slide” are heady, high-energy anthems that conjure warm-weather visions of glossed lips, short skirts, and nights spent racing down the length of Toronto’s Queen St. W. This is SadBoi at her best—floating over audacious production, delivering ego-boosting body talks that overflow with confidence: “Step outside I look too good, nah, this ain’t just on socials/Got all mans in chokehold, stand up, do you want a photo?” Delivering us directly to a sweaty Toronto dancefloor packed with queer, Black, and brown partygoers bubbling, wining, and twerking, she shouts out a favorite selector and MC (“If Jordior is spinning, then you know I’m gonna slide/IfKashdey pon the mic, then you know batty’s gonna fly”)."

    "review_text": "Oscar Wilde knew it, Roald Dahl knew it, andBlack Moth Super Rainbowknow it, too: the most fucked-up stories are fairy tales. In the grainyvideofor “All 2 of Us,” the woozy lead single ofSoft New Magic Dream, grotesque clowns gnaw on hamburgers with their mouths open, salivate over human flesh, and bare their fangs with sadistic, slack-jawed glee. It’sR.L. Stine’s The Haunting HourmeetsAriel Pink’sHaunted Graffiti, a psych-pop lullaby set against a psychological thriller. In the insular world of BMSR, is it necessarily new? For two decades and counting, the Pittsburgh band has churned out synthy dreamscapes with a dreadful edge, music for the moment a weed brownie makes you nauseous. At the band’s online shop, you can purchase a vinyl record, or, if you like, ashrunken head preserved in eternal anguish. If this new album is an attempt, in the words of its first song, to “Open the Fucking Fantasy,” the desire seems misplaced—the fantasy has been open, and unchanging, since 2003. Is it still magic or just muscle memory?\nOn their first album in seven years, there is evidence for both: some moments that surprise, and others that make the fantasy feel formulaic. Black Moth Super Rainbow’s sound remains distinctly their own, which is impressive considering the referential era they outlived. In the mid-2000s, when they released their earliest and most enduring work, hypnagogic pop was in vogue, as was hauntology—home-recorded soundtracks for half-remembered dreams. What BMSR did differently than, say,John MausandJames Ferraro, was pinpoint not the depressive downfall, but the even-eerier period when everything feelstoookay. Their best songs were deceptively wistful, mourning someone who wasn’t there, something that hadn’t happened yet. On the new album, though, this funhouse-meets-funeral concept more often feels rehearsed—a mysterious band demystified by its own increasingly unmysterious vibe.\nThat the mystery still hits, even if only sometimes, is a testament to how strong the BMSR spell can be. WhileSoft New Magic Dreamlargely re-hashes the Black Moth Super Rainbow formula, it also occasionally manages to find new colors in old constraints—not abandoning their schtick, but not copy-pasting it either. In the slinky music breaks of “Unknown Potion,” you might make out traces of “Smile the Day After Today,” a sparse instrumental standout from 2009’sEating Us. Self-parody? No. A step forward? Also no: It’s the sound of a band whose longevity has left it standing in its own shadow. This feels particularly grating on tracks that go on for a little too long, like the otherwise-solid “Open the Fucking Fantasy.” By the third chorus—and for much of the LP—the magic carpet is indeed revved up. It would be nice if we went somewhere.\nBlack Moth Super Rainbow are led byTobacco, a semi-anonymous vocoder enthusiast with creepy-crawly music of his own. In some ways, BMSR represent an extension of his warped universe: same gooey typeface, same friendly-monster vocals, same sickly-sweet fever dream. For better or worse, his fingerprints are everywhere onSoft New Magic Dream. “Tastebud” is the strongest non-single here, in part because of its uncomfortable pauses—a trick that gaveHot Wet & Sassyits tense, impending-doom textures. It’s a rare moment that sounds like Black Moth Super Rainbow produced by Tobacco the eclectic artist, rather than Tobacco the eclectic artist putting away his MPC to stand behind a microphone. More often, we get less-exciting moments like “Demon’s Glue,” a five-minute song that plateaus in BMSR’s candy-colored comfort zone by minute two. Black Moth Super Rainbow are masters of their insular, very specific, Nyan Cat-adjacent musical world. More and more, it’s beginning to feel like Neverland: a place where no one ever grows up, but nothing ever changes."

    "review_text": "Every couple of years I return to my favorite video on YouTube: aseven-minute clipof the rapper then known asMos Defholding court in a studio, eliciting gasps and laughter from an unseen audience by recitingMF DOOMlyrics. This is all a capella; sometimes he adopts DOOM’s meter to emphasize its fine-watch precision, but more often, Mos breaks the spell and draws out the ends of lines as if he’s in utter disbelief: “Read the signs: ‘No Feeding the Baboons’???” he says, incredulously. “Seeing as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds???”\nToward the end of the video, Mos raps part ofMadvillainy’s “Meat Grinder.” That full-length collaboration with Madlib—one of the most anticipated, aggressively bootlegged, and ultimately acclaimed underground rap records of its time—vaulted DOOM to a new level of notoriety even as it threatened to overshadow everything that would follow. But for the most part, the verses that captivate Mos are fromMM..FOOD, the 2004 album that punctuated one of the great madcap runs in rap history. At another point, someone from offscreen suggests that rapping alongside DOOM would be a challenge. The famously virtuosic MC shakes his head. “It would be fun,” Mos says. “He rhymes as weird as I feel.”\nWhat is most striking aboutMM..FOOD—which Rhymesayers has reissued in a 20th-anniversary edition that includes a handful of remixes and brief clips from a previously unheard interview—is the way DOOM blends his absurd character sketches with real autobiography, his outre zaniness with something grimily naturalistic. Though nearly rendered a footnote at the time byMadvillainy,FOODcaptures DOOM at his funniest and most mercenary. For a record that seems determined, at every turn, to lower the stakes—the culinary motif, the bizarre structure that leaves the middle of the tracklist completely bereft of vocals—FOODstands alongside 1999’s titanicOperation: Doomsdayas the most fully realized creation of rap’s greatest eccentric.\nThat mercenary bent is clear both in and outside of the text. At a glance, a few of the specs would suggest a tossed-off side project or the begrudging fulfillment of contractual obligation: the aforementioned suite of instrumentals, the apparent crowbarring into a release schedule. When he raps that he “plots shows like robberies/In and out, one, two, three—no bodies, please,’’ the second bar sounds an awful lot like “nobody’s pleased,” which would be a fitting reaction to DOOM’s well-documented practice of sending doppelgangers to lip sync and collect fees from club owners. That this couplet is rapped on a song cut fromMadvillainywould only seem to confirmFOODas a minor work."

    "review_text": "SincePlayboi Cartiditched the underground Atlanta collective around Awful Records for Harlem’s chic A$AP clique a decade ago, his officially released music has had a specific vision. You can almost talk about him in eras, like you wouldTaylor Swift: From the cryptic teenager who dropped loosies on SoundCloud to the It Boy at the margins of the mainstream on hisdebut mixtape; from the ad-lib-happy stage diver who shook up popular rap culture onDie Litto the wannabe Dracula who redefined that culture with the rage-rap maximalism ofWhole Lotta Red. Thelong-hyped and teasedMUSIC—which has been in the works for almost five years but feels like it was made in a week-long bender—isn’t easy to shave down to a short description. Because rather than undergo another reinvention, Carti celebrates his status as the torch-bearer of modern Atlanta rap with an overwhelmingly self-indulgent 30-track flood ofeverything.\nMUSICis the synthesis of all of Carti’s impulses both good and bad: the inspired hip-hop head and transactional businessman; the disruptive rapper of his generation and the morally bankrupt social climber; a little grandiose self-mythologizingKanyehere, a little futuristic swag-era Atlanta nostalgia there; a sip of apoliticalTravis Scottblockbusters, and a shot ofFuture-style degeneracy. There’s also a lot of mixtapeWaynein his soul, down to the “I Am Music” slogan he ripped from the Hot Boy. On one listen, you might get the impression it’s a jampacked strip club CD hosted by Swamp Izzo, the loudmouthed DJ known for talking his talk on Atlanta street rap mixtapes of the 2010s and for his longtime residency at the adult lounge Blue Flame. On the next, it’s bloated streambait, fattened with big-time guests in service of selling concert tickets and merch.\nFor music that is almost exclusively about hanging out, getting laid, and poppin’ molly, there genuinely is so much going on. It’s 77 minutes of nonstop trap beat variants, EDM flourishes, half-finished and overthought songs, and Carti pulling off such a range of voice work he’s like the rap gameDana Carvey. Take “Crush,” the album’s second track, which expands on the EDC festival build-ups he got into while on tour forWLR.The synths ride without a drop for more than 30 seconds as Carti toasts to the possibility of getting to have sex—it’s both restrained and kind of silly. That moment is undercut as soon as the rattling drums kick in, and out come the played-out trifecta ofMike Dean-inspired guitars, Travis Scott catchphrases, and Kanye-brained church choir bullshit. “Evil J0rdan” has a similar problem. The wonky Cardo-produced track, a highlight of the singles Carti released at the top of 2024, is a blur of punchlines in a voice more worn down than a home-plate umpire who just called a doubleheader. But the album version is overwrought, with a long, atmospheric intro that seems like it was conceived by a PC Music poser."

    "review_text": "“What time is it?”Joe McPheeasked a crowd at Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, New York. The assembled students yelled back, “Nation Time!” It was 1970 and the multi-instrumentalist sounded like a hype man beamed in from the future, or a quarterback jazzing up his hometown throngs for a big game. Immortalized on McPhee’s iconic free-jazz LPNation Time,this exchange was influenced byAmiri Baraka, who was increasingly embedding the political rhetoric of the period’s Black activists into his poems. The Black Arts Movement, which saw culture and civil rights as integrally entwined, was in full flower, and McPhee had invested himself in the liberation struggles of his day. But this fleeting concert introduction bore the seeds of the 85-year-old legend’s career in other ways, too: It showed literature and music feeding on each other, passing wisdom back and forth.\nMcPhee’s work as an improviser, sometimes aggressive and loud, other times sputtering and tactile—on 1996’s brilliantAs Serious As Your Life,for example—has only become more informed by literature over time. He’s incorporated spoken word on several projects, including a 2003 collaboration with his late friendPauline Oliveros,Unquenchable Fire,that wove in passages from Rachel Pollack’s eponymous sci-fi novel. McPhee has slipped his own poems into a smattering of releases from across his wide discography; self-assured, theatrical, and coursing with both the quest of music and the desperation of everyday life, these poems might have their own place in the annals of American verse—that is, if they were presented on the page and not performed orally. But McPhee has tended to treat his full-throated, authoritative voice and lingual gift like just another instrument he can whip out on his one-man bandstand. It’s an appealing, romantic way to go through life as a poet.\nThis side of McPhee’s creativity finally took center stage on 2024’sMusings of a Bahamian Son, a CD of his poems decorated only with occasional soprano saxophone and Ken Vandermark’s clarinet. The first time McPhee had ever “collected” his verse,Musingswas both a sprawling compilation and a swift, surprising aesthetic shift. Yet that disc fell short because it leaned too much on McPhee’s bardic skill and swathed it in a clean, quasi-sterile atmosphere, neglecting the aspects of a speech recording that can mold it into a musical document.\nHis latest, the chillingI’m Just Say’n, strikes a superior balance, fostering an eerie ambience of seemingly incidental sounds and sparing melody, courtesy of Swedish saxophonistMats Gustafsson, that lends the readings an extra intensity. McPhee plays no instruments, but each cut is a feat of improvisation: The poems themselves are apparently extemporaneous, and the fact of being spoken, not written, means that they can never be delivered the same way twice. A couple of recognizable fragments, first heard onMusings, reappear here like familiar licks that a jazz player returns to during a solo. At a brief and engrossing 40 minutes,I’m Just Say’ntransforms McPhee’s world-weary jottings into a gut punch. This curveball of a release takes aim at the rampant inequality of the present day and simultaneously feels like the culmination of a strain in McPhee’s art that has long hidden in plain sight."

The Poznań composer plays aninstrumentthat he designed himself, utilizing metal and wooden pipes scavenged from old church organs across Greater Poland—some battered and bent, some leaning at odd angles. Sheets of paper stapled around their tips look like miniature sails; the bellows appears to be held together with duct tape. Kędra hascomparedthe rhythm of the bellows to a heartbeat, but this is no ordinary mortal pulse: The instrument’s jagged architecture resembles some fantastical robot monster’s ribcage.\nBy taking the pipes out of their liturgical setting and Frankensteining them into such a strange new configuration, Kędra might be reminding us that church organs were always meant to seem futuristic and superhuman—tools to keep the masses cowering before God. His new album,their internal diapasons, demolishes such hierarchies, rendering the pipe organ’s fundamental mystery in unusually intimate terms. Rather than looming imposingly above listeners, it meets them on their level; in place of triumphant harmonies and mathematical perfection are detuned intervals and soft, pleading sighs. Early Christians often built their churches atop pagan temples, obliterating all trace of the faiths that preceded them; Kędra’s album feels like it’s rewilding sacred ground, unleashing spirits that had been trapped for centuries.\ntheir internal diapasonsbegins with a whisper, air catching against metal edges. It’s a profoundly physical sound, redolent of heat and friction—halfway between noise and music, tones struggling to take shape from the hiss. The palette expands on “airborne,” where tentative, wheezing bursts alternate with bright, declarative chords. You can feel the effort of the air straining through the pipes; moving in short, jabbing strokes, the rhythm has the dogged pulse of a work song. In “principale,” a fistful of flickering drones rise and fall in pitch, microtonal vibrations rolling in waves as the notes rub against each other. The shirred textures suggest a hint of what might be digital manipulation, an impression that becomes stronger in “for how long were you silenced?,” where glitching chords cut in and out, and a spectral voice moans in the silvery haze.\nIt’s tempting to compare Kędra’s album toKali Malone’s organ music, with its unusual tuning systems and eerie harmonies, but a closer comparison might beMica Levi’sUnder the Skin—like that soundtrack, Kędra’s album frequently tips into the realm of pure texture, almost unnervingly severe. “drzazgi”—“splinters” in Polish—is the album’s darkest track, buffeted by foghorn blasts, hooting owls, and what might be a sack of flour being dropped on a stone floor."

Like most rappers, his first forays into SoundCloud were uneven pastiches: deadpanrapswith the nonchalant exuberance of earlyMadeinTYO, attempts to mirror themelodramaof Slayworld, andglimpsesof absurdity that set the stage for his current work. In 2021, his plugg-driven “Arc’teryx” even became a minor hit on TikTok. But according to YT, it didn’t truly click until he heardXaviersobased’s jerk-infused 2022 song “patchmade” and discovered a new playground of bungee-jumping melodic riffs.#STILLSWAGGIN, compiled during YT’s final year of university in 2023, blended the playful energy of new wave bounce with 2010s nostalgia and laced it with politically incorrect punchlines that usually wouldn’t leave the group chat. His new album,OI!, builds on the jerk sound with compact flows that stutter like a skipping record yet glide like a figure skater. The only misstep is when YT focuses too much on the thrill of success rather than the charm of his idiosyncrasies.\nWhat initially drew me into YT’s music was its hyperspecific UK perspective, wrapped in a distinctly Zoomer brand of humor. There was so much joy in hearing him scrap the mayor’sLondon Planand sketch out his own version on#STILLSWAGGIN.On “#PURRR,” he traversed the country completing missions to meet up with girls (“Got a girl that live in Chelsea, said her daddy is an earl/Got an Oxford girl at Jesus, so I’m linkin’ heron Turl”).OI!still has flashes of that regional wit, like when he blurts out, “With a posh girl, think her parents voted Brexit” on “Put Your Hands Up,” but they’re less frequent. Now they’re getting replaced with rudimentary lines like “Mixed girl, black and white like panda” and some of that hyperlocal appeal is diluted.\nFortunately these beats are fun as hell. YT’s motley crew of producers take turns expanding on the nuances of jerk with instrumentals that hit like relentless 1-2 punches. Minor oddities—bubble bursts, clap pattern switch-ups, glossy synth pads—take each track a little off-kilter in the best way. The tension Kare creates between the sturdy 808s and the superhero power-up synth on standout “Missed Your Call I’m on a Flight Right Now” is the perfect alley-oop for YT to break the fourth wall at the end of his verse (“And the hook’s coming back right now, so get up, get up”). A sample ofSwedish House Mafia’s “One” on “Put Your Hands Up” supercharges the chanted hook to stadium proportions. Stringing it all together is the trademark “Oi!” ad-lib, a rallying cry with a long history in the UK punk scene; to signify his own work belongs in the same pantheon, YT juxtaposes it with annoying streamer voiceovers."

Clayton Pettet, is certainly no stranger to desire’s creative potential. For a specific subset of chronically online queers, his transformation fromTumblr-famous performance-art twinkinto beefy pansexual party boy has been a decade in the making. The playfully outlandish himbo facade belies a tender heart beating under a big chest (just barely) covered by atrackie. This Venusian eroticism has been central to Babymorocco’s whole schtick since he wasposing naked with flowersand servingCaravaggioit-boy.\nOnAmour,Babymorocco’s aptly titled first full-length, the romance (and raunch) are turned up until the speakers burst. Between link-ups with producerdear cupidandfrequent collaboratorsFrost Children, he chiseled the electro sleaze of debut EPThe Soundinto uber-horny electropop of the highest grade. Babymorocco is caught somewhere betweenSnow Strippers,early Crystal Castles, andthe Dare(if he had sex appeal). It’s music that wouldn’t at all feel out of place in aSkinsepisode, the soundtrack to a rave where a bunch of young Brits are getting absolutely fucked.\nOn its slick surface,Amouris an uncomplicated party album. Given the state of the world, leaning into playful hedonism isn’t unwelcome—see the massive 2024Charli XCXhad withBrat.In the same vein, Babymorocco zeroes in on the human desires and concerns tied to raving until sunrise. For every song about dancing next to someone with “big boobs and a tiny little waist” (a cheeky line from self-referential “Rocco”), there’s another about a search for real connection—dare I say, love.\nBabymorocco is high on a number of things onAmour. He’s on flights, he’s in love, he’s snorting whatever’s on the table at the afties. On soaring club track “Red Eye,” which channels old-school EDM, he confronts a former beau over a blaring drop bolstered by handclaps and vocoder distortion. The emotional reflection comes about halfway, after an onslaught of tracks that double as a shamelessly fun masterclass in electroclash revival. “Really Hot” channels the vanity Babymorocco embodies into a confident anthem bursting with chugging bass and synth. The lyrics might be more insufferable (“When they look at me I’m hot/I get paid cause I’m attractive”) if the song itself wasn’t exactly what you would want to hear in the background as you tighten your corset and put on your heels before a night out."

Yet for all of its refinement and progress,caroline 2allows its creators to fully embrace their role as UK post-rock’s preeminent sentimentalists. From the very beginning, the songs of the London octet have contained a sense of earnest wonder: Early single “Good Morning (Red)” was initially inspired by some members’ political awakening while canvassing for the Labour Party in 2017. But by its release years later, “Good Morning” had become an elegy, ascaroline’s egalitarian, eight-member setup was as close as the band got to witnessing a socialist revolution. And like so many idealistic collectives, caroline’s obsessions with process occasionally came at the expense of product; the mesmerizing interplay captured in their live “PoolSessions,” released in 2020 and 2021, was tempered by idle found-sound interludes on their self-titled2022 debut.Profiles of the band, meanwhile, were loaded with procedural details that read like the minutes of a committee board meeting.\nThey also tried towalk backevery mention of “Midwestern emo” in their formative influences, but they’re not beating the allegations this time around. Imagine ifAmerican Footballmoved to Chicago after graduating college and got taken under the wing ofGastr Del SolandTortoiseinstead of breaking up. That’s the sound ofcaroline 2: yearning, irresolute melodies; plaintive, plainspoken lyrics; and hours of analog improvisation are honed in painstaking digital post-production. Let theSquids andGreeps in their peer group be arch, absurd, aggro, abrasive; caroline also look at modern existence and ask, “Can you believe this shit” with their eyes wide rather than rolling.\nOpener “Total euphoria” is the most beguiling rock anthem of recent memory—every instrument plays behind the beat, so unquantized that it initially sounds like eight people recording in completely different rooms, or perhaps locked into a cryptic rhythm known only to its participants. The effect is both mesmerizing and nerve-wracking, like watching a marathoner push to the finish line after hitting the wall,Willis Reed limping into immortality. Anyone who’s listened to five minutes of post-rock knows the crescendo is coming, but when it does, “Total euphoria”implodesrather than explodes; the title holds because this moment delivers nothing shy of the thrill of victory or the sweet release of death. Conversely, “Song two” is bisected by strings that sound bowed by bonesaws, teasing a horror-movie jumpscare; instead, the rusted trapdoor opens to let in blinding sunlight and unseasonable warmth."

    "review_text": "The Innocence Missionhave been around so long that they know what it’s like to both capture and practically fall out of the cultural consciousness. When the original four members met back in the early 1980s, during their Catholic high school’s production ofGodspell,they couldn’t deny their congruities: warm, easygoing, soft-spoken students with a knack for folk-rock and dream pop. Fast forward a few years and the Innocence Mission was born: primary singer-songwriter Karen Peris and guitarist Don Peris got married, their debut album came out on A&M in 1989, and comparisons toKate Bushandthe Sundaysearned them a cult following. Depending on how old you are, you might know the Innocence Mission from their interviews on MTV’s120 Minutes, appearances onLate Night With David Lettermanand theEmpire Recordssoundtrack, orSufjan Stevens’ breathtaking rooftop cover of “The Lakes of Canada.” Now long out of the spotlight but with a sound that’s largely unchanged, the husband-and-wife duo and original bassist Mike Bitts are approaching the end of middle age onMidwinter Swimmers, their 13th album, with even more unbarred earnestness, a sharp contrast to the jaded stances permeating modern life.\nNow nearly 40 years into her recording career, Karen Peris’ voice remains as delicate and angelic as when she was a teenager—and still unmistakably her own. Close your eyes and it's the voice Matilda imaginedMiss Honeyhaving: delicate, sprightly, encouraging; her chirp fit for innocent conversations between book stacks (an Innocence Mission dreamscape lucky Borders shoppers oncestumbled across). That weightlessness turns the album’s title track into a curious and soothing tale of longing, and “Your Saturday Picture” into an evocative tale of yearning with childlike insouciance. Occasionally she crunches a word in her mouth likeBjörk, wide and mawkish, like each “sing on” uttered in “Sisters and Brothers.” Even when sadness seeps into her heart seconds later (“I lost something I used to be before/I don’t know why I’m crying”), Peris finds equanimity in the way tree branches and birds carry on in troubled weather. While her husband plucks and strums various guitars to add texture, Peris’ sweet voice summons cottagecore imagery naturally: leafy rhubarb, Appaloosa horses, leaves falling onto her head like a crown. It’s no wonder she was once invited to sing onJoni Mitchell’sNight Ride Home.\nWith age, Peris’ stories have grown more personal and straightforward, though not without their usual charm.Midwinter Swimmersis an album born from observations on her daily walks and pangs of longing during time apart from her husband. She cultivates a grand vision of romance in a song about their alternate dream life on the coast of Maine, living alongside sunlit moss and a picturesque striped lighthouse. But it’s the little asides dotting each track that showcase her affection best: “Saving up all these things to tell you,” ”Wait for me/I miss all the buses lately,” “I would race all the blocks of town to you.” Karen and Don Peris structure these songs to burst with love in the glow of ’60s folk pop, and the rush of those highs—the back half of “This Thread Is a Green Street” cascades with lavish harmonies and a surprise rhythm-section reveal—draws a straight line through theinfluencesfrom their childhoods: the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor. “In five o’ clock raindrops/You stop to take a picture/Of you and me,” she sings in “Cloud to Cloud.” “We’re carrying guitars, groceries, and flowers/Everything is light.” Illustrating the tender moment in full color, Don leans heavier into his drumkit and electric guitar while Karen answers with melodica, a playful back-and-forth of musical PDA."

A decade removed from the goth tropes they adored, both bands scored a chart crossover at the same time. “1979” and “Stupid Girl” formed part of the scrim of 1996: beatwise, shrewd about electronic manipulations, lavishing hooks upon chewy hooks, and posting lyrics as vivid as graffiti. In 1998, as the Pumpkins’ mass popularity plateaued, Garbage releasedVersion 2.0, theParallel Linesof the Y2K era, on which singerShirley Mansonand her male colleagues lustily pillaged genre after genre until their reconfigurations of saint, sinner, whore, and angel tropes gleamed anew. The Pumpkins may have collected the multi-platinum certs, butVersion 2.0madeAdore,Billy Corgan & co.’s committed take on what we then called “electronica,” sound wan.\nWith both acts playing to their respective cults these days, it’s worth pondering what a Garbage fan looks like in 2025—a ’90s nostalgist? Herein lies the curse of being a second-tier act. An experiment begun as a diversion forNirvana/Pumpkins producer Butch Vig and mates Duke Erickson and Steve Marker took off when their studio expertise meshed with Manson’s talent for pastiche. During that pre-internet false dawn when the CD boom rekindled curiosity about bygone sounds, Garbage—energized by a well-chosen record collection—epitomized a savvy, smart present that few confused with the future. They had a sell-by date.\nNevertheless, they’ve kept on keeping on, still capable of impeccable assemblages of fuzz and melody, and their disgust at the rise of authoritarianismdistinguishes themfrom their contemporaries. A series of incisive and gently brutal tracks on 2021’sNo Gods No Mastersdemonstrated that Garbage still had it. Slip “Godhead” and “The Creeps” on a playlist next to evergreens like “Supervixen” and “I Think I’m Paranoid” and no one will blink. By contrast, new albumLet All That We Imagine Be the Lightis as tentative as mid-period albumsBleed Like MeandNot Your Kind of People.Manson still sounds uncannily fierce and in command; the songs are rudderless, neither here nor there. A fabulous conceit in search of referents, “There’s No Future in Optimism” sums up the problem. Those guitars-as-keyboards and vice versa still boast a processed vigor, but after sketching an apocalyptic party-like-it’s-1999 scenario in the first verse, Manson has nothing else to say except to repeat “future love love future” as a hook."

    "review_text": "Typically, when an artist stays out of our view, every public gesture he or she does make is loaded with extra significance. Think of the ways each demo, cover, or bit of extramusical trivia is instantly subsumed into the canons ofD’Angelo,Fiona Apple, orFrank Ocean. But given howCorbin, who drifted from SoundCloud stardom to deeper recesses of the internet, has released music—firstunder a different, instantly infamous stage name, and then in intermittent bursts that suggest a true disregard for self-promotion and self-mythologizing—the temptation is to receive his songs as a series of experiments, tips of an iceberg that will languish in a Google Drive folder until it melts.\nThe grey cover of his new album,Crisis Kid, seems to threaten that this release might disappear into the digital morass. But the LP is a project of striking ambition. It aims to marry optimistic melodies with writing that probes uncomfortably deep into questions of morality and feelings of existential exhaustion—and almost always succeeds. It’s lean and pointed, refusing to sacrifice its depth for a cleaner shape or its hooks for the sake of mood.\nAfter that initial burst of online notoriety under the Spooky Black moniker, Corbin joined fellow Twin Cities natives Allan Kingdom, Bobby Raps, and Psymun in Thestand4rd. While that quartet only released one album—their moody, insinuating self-titled effort from 2014—they did seem to presage many of rap and R&B’s sonic developments over the next decade. This is, in part, because they’ve had a hand in its creation: Bobby has written and produced extensively for artists likeFuture,Lil Uzi Vert, andThe Weeknd, on whose records hisown wailing pleasare wrangled into a more commercial shape, while Psymun has contributed production to a similarly impressive array of headliners. Through these years, Corbin has lingered like a specter on the fringes of Bobby and Psymun’s work, his vocals the literalization of the emotional pain their production frequently channels.\nPsymun’s hand was key in craftingCrisis Kid. He infuses even the most unadorned songs, like “Come Down,” with his wonky melancholy; “Clown On Stage” is languid enough to make the listener want to crawl out of his skin. The wistful guitars and slyly tricky drum programming give nearly every song not only welcome texture, but a foreboding air. That sort of patience with tempo and slipperiness with tone is key for Corbin’s project, which relies on his ability to seem impossibly comfortable in the face of despair in some moments, and too overcome to keep in step with the production in others. In fact, flitting back and forth between unflappability and panic is not only an effective mode for Corbin’s work, but frequently its subject."

Yet he fought tooth and nail against the release ofLive! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962,eventually released in 1977.\nThe recordings were made by Star-Club stage manager Adrian Barber at the behest of Ted “Kingsize” Taylor, a fellow Liverpool musician who’d played a run of shows with the Beatles with his band the Dominoes in late 1962. The Beatles had a foot out the door at this point and were only contracted to play the Star-Club based on a deal made much earlier by their manager, Brian Epstein, who’d molded the boys into pros by the time they played the shows we hear here. They’d already put out “Love Me Do” in October of that year, so it’s not like this is a recording of a band you can’t find anywhere in better fidelity.\nIt’s exciting to hear them tear through a Dexedrine-tempo “Twist and Shout,” already in its final form, just waiting for a young John Hughes to have hismind blown by it. It’s a hoot to hear Star-Club co-owner Horst Fascher and his brother Fred as temporary Beatles, belting “Hallelujah, I Love Her So” and “Be-Bop-A-Lula” with the band in the boozy and low-key environment of a small club. As consistently good as their musicianship is, the performances may have been shakier than usual because the band was basically coasting at that point and ready to get back to England. The Star-Club is a container that cannot hold, andLive!plays like a rehearsal for the future, or a kiss-off to the past.\nBut the great lacuna of the Beatles catalog is the music they madebeforethis show: the lineups with Tommy Moore, Norman Chapman, Stuart Sutcliffe, and the other youths who passed through the Beatles in their pre-Fab days; the alleged hour-long versions of “What’d I Say” they’d improvise to pass the time; a piss-drunkJohn Lennonimitating Hitler with a comb as a mustache and haranguing the “Krauts” in the audience."

When she announcedrosie, her solo debut solo with Atlantic, Rosé hinted that listeners would get a new perspective on her—not just a taste of who she is as an artist, but also a peek into her interior life. “Rosie - is the name I allow my friends and family to call me,” she wrote in an OctoberInstagram postintroducing the record. “With this album, I hope you all feel that much closer to me.” Butrosielacks the sense of identity required to tell this story, boasting only dated pop references and a generic feeling of lingering heartache.\nThis question of personal identity is a fraught one in K-pop. So much of the genre is built upon the project of fantasy, where idols are treated like canvases for bigger ideas and themes. The cost of this approach, often, is the idol’s unique self—or, at least, the consumer’s understanding of it. While impressions of the idol’s personality are scattered acrossbehind-the-scenes vlogs, candidlivestreams, and maybe a personal Instagram account (if their company allows it), this human touch is rarely expressed in the music itself. Though let’s be clear: In K-pop, this quality is not commonly a point of contention, or even a factor that makes or breaks the entertainment value.\nThe lack of personal identity doesn’t always serve idols who branch out solo—after all, many are trained to perform as part of a whole.Soridata, a site that aggregates data for Korean music, reports that female soloists have received only 9.3 percent of music-show awards since 2007. (Many wins can be attributed to singer-songwriter IU, who has recorded solo since 2008.) That hasn’t stopped BLACKPINK’s members from trying, however. In late 2023, Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa, and Rosé chose not torenew their individual contracts with YG Entertainment(though they didrenew their contract for group activitiesas BLACKPINK), opting to move away from the agency for their solo ventures. By the time the news reached the public, Jennie had established her label,Oddatelier, followed shortly by Lisa’s company,LLOUD, and the announcement of their respective record deals.\nFor her part, Rosé broke out withrosie’s lead single “APT.,” an infectious pop-rock collaboration withBruno Mars. Despite the track’s simple structure and premise, which riffs on a Korean drinking game, Rosé lets loose. Her vocals soar over fuzzy synths and catchy percussion, narrating the highs, lows, and inherent humor of a night spent in a drunken stupor. Crucially, the song showcases her most valuable instrument: her voice, a malleable asset that can chant, shout, harmonize, and sing without losing the timbre that makes it recognizable in any language."

    "review_text": "Success changedBLACKPINKforever, for better and worse. At the height of their popularity, the Korean girl group shifted their focus towards Western audiences, making diluted songs that felt ready-made forKidz Bop. It was an honest mistake. For 30 years, K-pop acts rarely contended with the rubric of American pop music, whose stylistic conservatism thwarts K-pop’s compelling genre agnosticism. Authenticity is more heavily scrutinized inA-poptoo, and the BLACKPINK members’ solo debuts have looked anemic under this microscope.Rosé’srosielacked interiority andLISA’sAlter Egowhiffed its titular premise. Jisoo’sAmortagefared better, but only because it embraced anonymity.JENNIE’sRubyadopts a similar tack, but the production is more ambitious, the songwriting more accomplished. If JENNIE has the most robust individual musical identity of the quartet, it’s because her songs have a crucial element the others’ lack: They sound good.\nIt is painfully obvious when hearing “like JENNIE” that the BLACKPINK members all needed a song like this, one that translates their tough-girl sound into a blistering new style. Here, JENNIE sings atop a metallic beat that hybridizes baile funk and phonk, and her snarled delivery is especially convincing when it flits between Korean and English. While she hardly flaunts her bilingual prowess elsewhere, “ZEN” offers art-pop pomp with pounding drums that are as traditional as they are imperial. Reminiscent of Lim Kim’sGENERASIAN, it exudes a bracing confidence that overshadows its flimsy lyrics. This is the secret toRuby: It’s less “fake it till you make it” than “make it so youcanfake it.” She lacks the conviction ofDoechiion their collaboration “ExtraL,” but the sleek synths, beat switches, and chanted vocals provide enough window dressing to keep you invested.\nJENNIE excels on these tracks because she knows how to play the game. Much likeRihanna, she’s been lambasted for lazy performances and an indifference towards honing her vocals, but she also has enough charisma—a stylish flair—to carry weaker productions. “Mantra” is too minimal for its own good, but JENNIE’s insistent, needling hook forms an earworm by sheer force. “Starlight” is a gaunt, slow-motionPinkPantheressriff, but its introspection is believable because of her impassioned singing. While some tracks are duds—“Twin” is an acoustic ballad with embarrassingly generic details, and “Seoul City” meanders aimlessly—most ofRubyproves she’s a natural. “start a war” is a lighters-upSZAanthem that sidesteps gaucheABGAAVE, her vacillating vocal rhythms mirroring a relationship’s push-pull tensions.\nThe clearest testament to JENNIE’s versatility is that she’s never out of place among her features. She sounds at home on “Handlebars,” an unassailable collaboration withDua Lipa. Theirlast songtogether was an awkward pop Mad Lib, but the two trade verses here as if close friends, bonding over their tendency to crush hard. “Damn Right,” aMike WiLL Made-Itco-production, serves asRuby’s most sultry moment. AlongsideKali UchisandChildish Gambino—the latter of whom dons his bestAndré 3000impression—the three revel in a night of hushed come-ons. When JENNIE delivers the barebones hook (“Damn right, I did that/Damn right, yeah”) like she’s whispering under her breath, her satisfaction is palpable. It recalls the album’sf(x)-likeintro, built on little more than snatches of her voice. These moments embodyRuby’s effortless charm: Sometimes, JENNIE’s presence is enough.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "AsKelora, Kitty Hall and Benedict Salter craft gothic cyberfolk that speaks to the sick Victorian child dwelling within us all. The London-based Glaswegian duo’s solemn atmospheres balance gauzy acoustic guitars and lacy melodies that sound as if they’ve been resurrected from a malfunctioning music box. Their lyrical world is replete with the wistfulness of sunsets, the vitality and vibrancy of blood, and an ambivalence, sometimes indifference, to death—the kind of world where strangers meet and fall into a casually morose and existential conversation. “A lonely visitor walks with the tide/‘Hello there, do you want to die?’” Hall sings on “Fake Future,” from their 2023 debutGloomerald. “‘No, I'm just trying hard to pass the time,’” she continues. Kelora’s spectral music creates momentum by disarming and softening melancholy; that progress is sometimes entrancing, sometimes lethargic.\nTheir latest album,Sleepers,furthers this obsession with disorienting tension, filled with references to sleep, dreams, and the semi-conscious states where reality blurs. Despite Hall’s sweet, whispery coos and the songs’ lullaby qualities, any moment of shuteye is followed by a heavy unease. “We’ll fall asleep and learn/I dreamed I saw the palace burn/We’re going where we won’t return,” she sings on “Bluebells.” For Kelora, sleep becomes a reminder of life’s impermanence. “I fell asleep in Glasgow/in 2025/Nothing ever lasts but/you’ve gotta survive,” goes a line on “In A Million Streams.”\nSleepersis more ambitious than its predecessor,Gloomerald, working harder to charm the listener into an inescapable labyrinth. The percussion tinkers and creeps. Backing vocals expand and shift like glowing orbs. The duo’s signature acoustic guitars feel like a heated blanket under the chill of Halls’ voice, which barely rises above a whisper. WhereGloomeraldwas limited to hushed tones andElliott Smith-esque strums,Sleepersis filled with electronic manipulations that evoke hallucinatory memories. When the chorus comes on “When the Floods Come, You’ll Be an Island,” a warped operatic sample pierces through, like a possessed gramophone, only to be eclipsed by waves of Hall’s shimmering vocals, as if to convince us the moment was just our imagination.\nOn the surface, Kelora’s gossamer embrace is innocent enough—like a child ghost passing eternity in a pre-war apartment. But while entertaining a poltergeist might be thrilling, it’s also draining, slowly sucking away your life force. On the singsongy “Aura,” they sing a resounding lyric in a hurried tone: “The darkness is sublime but don’t let the dreams bury you.” It’s a hushed warning before the chorus: “We don't understand what it means,” a candid admission that feels like a sweet surrender after wading through songs with so much uncertainty.Sleepersis a misery-loves-company album that romanticizes moments of gloomy depression, rather than chasing away the darkness by letting in the light. Kelora’s music underscores that embracing bleakness, in measured doses, can be a unique comfort—which, depending on your mood, can feel like an indulgent luxury or a brooding endurance test."

    "review_text": "There’s no collective in America commanding the youth like Opium is right now. Somewhere between cold nonchalance and masochistic vitriol lies the Atlanta-based neo-punk brigade, a coven of rappers and producers who mold piercing distortion into organized bedlam. WhenPlayboi Cartilaunched the label with the release of 2020’sWhole Lotta Red, he was already readying his first protégé.\nAllow me to reintroduceKen Carson, patient zero of the Opium Plan, one of the world’s biggest rappers born in the 21st century. Ascending from Carti fan to Carti confidant, the diamond-grilled ruffian dethroned bars and rhyme schemes in favor of bludgeoning skulls with his bloodshot delivery. He’s an avatar for Opium’s dark, irreligious imagery, often seen with a St. Peter’s cross around his neck. Last year, he tatted a pentagram on his chest and commissioned cover art of abuck 50 scaron his face. As his embrace of the macabre has grown tighter, Ken Carson’sheadstrongsynthplayhas become bitterly malevolent. It’s a mutated extension ofRed’s vampiric lure that Opium stans can’t get enough of: The Brooklyn listening party for his 2023 opus,A Great Chaos, was packed with disciples howlingnewly releasedsongs word for word. “Opium aesthetic, yuh, type shit,” Ken boldlyremarkedon that album.\nMore Chaosis Ken Carson’s affirmation of his influence. He is aware of his standing in rap culture now, almost to the point of spoofing the demon he’s posturing as. “I’m the lord of chaos/I got the moshpit in control,” he declares after an alarming techno breakdown splits the album open. For better or for worse, he’s right. Opium’s lurid approach to sound and aesthetics has the kids in a headlock; at any rap festival in the past five years, you’d find fans draped in all black with painted nails and pants so baggy they can’t see their shoes. They’re rowdy and inconsolable at Opium sets, flailing and shoving even before a DJ takes the stage. It’s all by design—Carti, Ken,Destroy Lonely, and company have distilled the symbolism of metal and the ethos of punk into an apolitical soup. There is no underlying message—this is rebellion just for the sake of saying “Fuck 12.” These are ourSex Pistols: The music at its best is rabid and freakishly exhilarating. At its worst, it exposes the empty core of its depravity. An environment that cultivates something likeMore Chaosis one where drug binges and violent misogyny go unchecked.\n“How you mourn? What you gon’ do when that pain hit?” Ken Carson asks on “Xposed,” the album’s second track. “I been rockin’, I been ravin’, I been ragin’.” The scope of Ken’s catalog can be summed up by these words alone. With each new album (More Chaosis his fourth), the hedonistic impulses reach new extremes. It’s reflected in the lyricism, but it’s the sound palette that really gets pushed to the brink. The trench warfare of 2023’s “Hardcore” and “Lose It” are superseded by the hellish whir of “Xposed” and the double-sided clamor of “LiveLeak.” Hall-of-famesnippet-turned-banger “Money Spread” warbles like a spaceship with a corrupted motherboard. Ken’s best work relies on this kind of raw urgency andMigos-level repetition that I wish this album had more of. “LiveLeak” is nearly as addictive, translating the crunchy, lo-fi elements of thesnippetto the final mix: Mangled synths and snares,Mario Karttrills, and gruff 808s rumble like Goliath’s footsteps. Egged on by a calamitous beat switch, Ken raps like he’s a button-press away from a tectonic shift. When the mood softens later in the album, he loses the edge that makes these tracks so enticing."

    "review_text": "OnEvery Video Without Your Face, Every Sound Without Your Name,Lucy Liyoucoalesces years of heartache into an unadorned collection of songs that burn with fervor. Her diaphanous soundscapes are backdrops for supplication, requests for witness and acceptance. Starting with text-to-speech mosaics made as a teen (her debut,Welfare, was released onKlein’s label), Liyou swiftly fabricated her own amalgamation ofelectroacoustic collageandtheatrical sound poetry. Each release has expanded her nebula of classical piano, experimental ambient, and intimate ballads; her new album carries this steady pulse into her finest, most restrained work to date.\nThe genesis ofEvery Videocan be traced to Liyou’s college years, when she began writing songs about the deficient familial love she experienced as a young closeted trans person. The record is also colored by the end of a more recent relationship, though “it’s not a breakup album,” Liyou explained in press materials. Instead, she found a strange harmony between these two life phases, prompting her to rework old songs as a way to process the present. Complex as the underlying emotions may be, Liyou lays them out with her most direct music to date, primarily piano and vocals.\nThe most remarkable aspect ofEvery Videois its space. Though Liyou somewhat cheekilyreferredto it as a “songs record,” the album trembles with an undercurrent of emptiness. Lush piano chords and desperate swells are merely a membrane between lacunose melodies on opener “16/8.” Instead of her usual field recordings and clipped samples, these songs are overwhelmed by plaintive lyrics and the hollowness of unreciprocated affection. “No Tide Aorta” dissolves into unnerving static, bringing to mind the fraying piano etudes ofRyuichi Sakamoto’s final releases. “Jokes About Marriage” echoes the translucent vulnerability ofFKA twigs’ “Cellophane,” with weeping saxophone fromCole Pulice. Liyou’s silence is not that of a vacuum, but that of anticipation.\nAlbum centerpiece “Arrested” is a perfect encapsulation of the underlying sound language Liyou has been unraveling. Her voice is at its most present, whether Auto-Tuned or austere, whispered or stacked in melismatic harmony with vocalist and composer Mingjia Chen. The track builds pressure before erupting with an imploring demand to “learn to love what I am now.” It is a plainly communicated need to be seen in this exact moment, to be freed of the imposter’s burden. The song’s clearest antecedent in passionate crystalline eternity isSOPHIE’s “Is It Cold in the Water?” from see-sawing waves of synths on up."

    "review_text": "Christian FenneszwroteThe Last Days of Mayforan installationat the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The longest piece of the Austrian artist’s solo career, the 24-minute composition is alternately pretty and foreboding, with a long, droning core occasionally jostled by sudden changes. It’s substantial enough to feel like a Fennesz album in miniature. That in-between format is the calling card ofLongform Editions, the Australian record label—or “gallery for listening,” as they put it—that releasedThe Last Days of Mayas part of its final drop, wrapping up seven years and over 150 releases with a titan of experimental music. Fennesz’s contribution is a fitting farewell, underlining the unique, prompt-based approach of the label as well as its ability to coax the best out of its artists, known and relatively unknown alike.\nLongform Editions started out with the intention of approaching music more like a group exhibition. Every two months, a new batch of four releases appeared simultaneously, highlighting the differences and the commonalities between the artists featured. The prompt was simple: one extended piece at least 20 minutes long, though many ended up stretching longer than that (and a few slightly shorter). The results were often spectacular, pulling artists out of their comfort zones and teasing out ideas they might not come up with otherwise. Some were ambient or meditative; some were simply longer versions of their usual practice. Fennesz’s piece falls into that latter camp, and it makes you wish he’d stretch out more often.\nLast year’sMosaicstripped Fennesz’s sound down to guitar so naked you could hear the pick cutting across the strings, and was constructed out of long jam sessions edited down into digestible chunks.The Last Days of Maysounds like aMosaiccompanion at first, starting with a distant rumble before a guitar strum cuts through the fog. It’s sharp and assertive, reverberating across the spectrum as though it were rotating through a Leslie speaker. But then it starts to fade, becoming one with the textures around it. All the while, an eerie melody, like a dungeon synth track layered below, holds it all together. Unlike the stuttering glitch of his classic work, here the throughline stays constant, morphing through filters and envelopes but holding steady.\nFenneszsaysthatThe Last Days of Maywas inspired by microtonality, the delay behavior of guitar strings, and, in particular, the technique of Birthday Party guitarist Rowland S. Howard. (Mostly, it just sounds like Fennesz to me.) He also says that the composition is meant to blur into the background, which doesn’t really do it justice. It’s actually the static, droning moments that lend it power—the way it goes from a hum to a roar and back again, with the methodical approach of a hand turning knobs rather than a laptop crunching numbers. It brings to mind images of Fennesz working in real time, unencumbered by post-processing. It doesn’t make a fully realized statement like his best albums, but it’s lovely to hear him try a more reserved and durational composition."

    "review_text": "Scott Morgan has hit a sweet spot in over 25 years of making music asLoscil. He’s in love with dub sound design, and erratic kicks and choppy filters hint at the pulse of techno, but his sound is never really “dub techno” per se, not least because it’s always pristinely recorded and rarely betrays the scuffmarks of post-Basic Channeldevelopments. If anything, he’s a Cascadian answer to the Europeans on Kompakt and Mille Plateaux who followed the ever-softening kick drum of ambient techno deeper into a womblike space. Just as the foggy majesty of black metalcarriesovernicelyfrom Norway to the Northwest, it makes sense that an artist from British Columbia would use the awestruck sounds of German ambient to evoke the breathtaking sweep of the Pacific rim.\nOne imagines Morgan would agree with fellow Northwest sound wizardPhil Elverumthat his home is “beautiful but troubled,” andLake Firemay be his most troubling album yet, inspired by the increasingly common experience of driving through burning West Coast landscapes. On one level, the record honors the cycles of death and rebirth that drive the region’s fire-reliant old-growth ecosystems. It was originally an ensemble record in the vein of his great 2004 albumFirst Narrows, but Morgan torched away at the products of those sessions until the only things left were his electronics and the distant moan of James Meger’s bass on “Ash Clouds.” Even without knowing how the album was made, it’s easy to notice the sound design is more weathered than usual, his pads taking on resonant overtones that feel like wind howling through a canyon.\nOn another level, the album continues the thread of apprehension that’s long been present in Loscil’s music, which is often about human encroachment on the natural world. It’s hard to imagine that Morgan is merely honoring natural cycles of “destruction and rejuvenation” in the wake of the LA fires and the other disasters that now grip the West Coast yearly and will probably soon flare up again. UnlikeWolfgang Voigt, the godfather of this stuff, Morgan is not a nature worshipper. He’s frank about his environment, and there’s always the uneasy awareness in his work that the “nature” ambient artists so frequently exalt is usually filtered through a middleman. The 2002 albumSubmerswas as much about the sublimity of the ocean as the vulnerable vessels used to explore it.Equivalents, from 2019, is about not clouds but a set of Alfred Stieglitz photographs of clouds."

    "url": "https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/willie-nelson-oh-what-a-beautiful-world/",
    "review_text": "Although it isn’t billed that way,Oh What a Beautiful Worldbelongs to a certain strain ofWillie Nelsonalbums dedicated to the songbook of a particular songwriter. It's a tradition Willie inaugurated in the late 1970s, when he released tributes to his honky tonk hero Lefty Frizzell and his fellow country maverick Kris Kristofferson, and has continued to the present day, saluting Harlan Howard with 2023’sI Don’t Know a Thing About Love. Nelson extends the homey, understated vibe of the latter withOh What A Beautiful World, which is devoted to the songs of Rodney Crowell, a fellow Texan who released his 1978 debut,Ain’t Living Long Like This, right as Willie rose to superstar status on the wave of the outlaw movement.\nNelson included a Crowell song, “’Till I Gain Control Again,” on the live albumWillie and Family Livethat year (a studio version would appear on 1983’sTake It to the Limit). Around that time, Willie’s running partner Waylon Jennings took Crowell’s “I Ain’t Living Long Like This” to the top of the Billboard Country charts—but Crowell could never quite be called an outlaw. Raised on country-rock and cowboy poets as much as honky tonk, Crowell could play by Nashville rules but quickly grew restless: After spinning out five consecutive Country No. 1 singles from 1988’sDiamonds & Dirt, he drifted away from the country mainstream, finding a home on the fringes of Americana.\nOh What a Beautiful Worlddraws heavily from recent Crowell albums, with half of its 12 songs originally released in 2013 and later. That, along with the placement of a pair of Crowell tunes on last year’sThe Border, suggests Nelson’s affection for the songwriter has grown in recent years. Willie doesn’t avoid poppier material from Crowell: The album opens with the insistent “What Kind of Love,” a hit from 1992, and also includes “Shame on the Moon,” a relaxed, ruminative ballad Bob Seger brought to the Billboard Top 10 in 1982, along with “Making Memories of Us,” which Keith Urban turned into a Country No. 1 in 2005. These lighter moments punctuate story songs, tunes of twilight heartbreak, Texas vignettes, and bemused character portraits.\nCrowell fills his songs with dryly vivid details, setting his lyrics to plainspoken, deceptively catchy melodies. Nelson prizes the same traits in his own songwriting, so it’s little wonder that these songs fit Willie as comfortably as an old pair of boots. Comfort is the rule onOh What a Beautiful World. Working once again with Buddy Cannon—his main producer since 2012, who temporarily stood aside last time around so Nelson’s son Micah could helmLast Leaf on the Tree—Willie is surrounded by his usual crew, who are content to pick up the tempo only once: for the wry blues shuffle “She’s Back in Town.” Cannon otherwise spends the album accentuating the band’s slow stroll by polishing each instrumental element until it gleams, turning this into one of the slickest-sounding Nelson records in recent memory.\nAll the grit and emotion onOh What a Beautiful Worldcomes from Willie. Age has done a number on his voice—he’s lost his upper octaves and no longer sings with gusto—but Nelson adjusts accordingly, conserving his energy so he can emphasize the tenderness of “The Fly Boy and the Kid,” deliver the verses of “Banks of the Old Bandera” with captivating understatement, and provide a sweet, gravelly counterpoint to Crowell’s good cheer as they duet on the title track. “Oh What a Beautiful World” also is graced by Nelson’s guitar, Trigger, with which he takes several spidery runs through the verses and chorus. Whenever Nelson seems frail, Trigger is robust, answering every one of the sung jokes on the closing “Stuff That Works.” Nelson never hits the punchline too hard, nor does he clutter his leads with unnecessary notes. He retains his innate sense of taste and showmanship; despite his diminished range he still sounds like himself. That indelible personality keepsOh What a Beautiful Worldengaging even when it flirts with sleepiness: Nelson can still make any song sound so personal, so idiosyncratic, it’s as if he’d written it.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "A little less than a decade ago—after a traumatic and tragic stint in Miami that led to time spent in a psychiatric care unit—Yung Leanbegan working on an album that he said sounded like a combination betweenDaniel JohnstonandLil Wayne. “I’m gonna release it as Yung Lean,” he toldThe Faderin 2016. “You put out three rap albums, then you can do whatever you like.” The resulting record didn’t really sound like the combination he described, and he didn’t release it as Yung Lean either, instead putting out the post-punk-inspiredPsychopath Balladsas jonatan leandoer127. Since then, Lean has often used this alias (which he changed tojonatan leandoer96in 2018) to channel his alternative, non-rap creative impulses: collaborations withDean Blunt, covers ofThis Mortal Coil, folk songs sung in Swedish. Elements of the side project have seeped into his work as Yung Lean as well; over the years, as he’s navigated maturity and sobriety, his albums have reliably featured more personal songwriting and genre experimentation. Fans track his character development with each new release.\nJonatan,his fifth studio album as Yung Lean, is an attempt at merging his various musical identities under one banner. Executive produced byFrank Oceancollaborator Rami Dawod, with contributions fromOneohtrix Point NeverandBeck, the album’s 13 songs are built around pared-down guitar and piano melodies and sparse drums, pushing Lean himself to center stage. This emphasis on his voice makes for some raw moments when Lean’s idiosyncratic delivery and the blunt production meet each other eye to eye. At other times,Jonatan’s stripped-down framework highlights his limitations as a vocalist and songwriter, veering into pastiche.\nThe album is Lean’s reckoning with breaking up, getting older, and spending the past 12 years making music for public consumption. In thevideofor “Forever Yung,” the first single, he holds a funeral procession for a past version of himself dressed as a king. The song’s narrator searches for authenticity in a world full of artifice, and its industrial rockabilly swing lends itself to Lean’s subdued melody. HisABBAinterpolation(and halfwayGil Scott-Heroninterpolation) on “Might Not B” sounds at home over a buzzing bassline, while his abstract writing and monotone sing-song are well suited to the toy music box synth on “Paranoid Paparazzi.” The album whirrs when the production is at its most dynamic: theColdplay-like string hits on “I’m Your Dirt, I’m Your Love,” and the dramatic choral backing on the OPN-assisted “Terminator Symphony” support some of the album’s most captivating vocal performances. On “Teenage Symphonies 4 God (God Will Only),” Lean fully commands the backing track, his voice full of anguish as he wails, “I’ve been so cold to everybody that loves me.”"

The origin story of Movietone, which is also that of the small but mighty Bristol scene its members and friends created together in the early 1990s, is in one sense an archetypal tale. But the music they made together during their run was theirs alone. Their albums were weather systems, handmade assemblages of creaky folk, jazz-derived rumble, and dream-pop that’d been dried in the sun, wrapped in packages that seemed as if they’d been discovered in a cobwebbed attic.\nKate Wright and Rachel Coe became friends at Cotham Grammar School in their early teens. They were outcasts drawn to art who felt they understood something the straight world didn’t. Naturally, they bonded overJoy Division,the Jesus and Mary Chain,the Cure. In an interview withThe Wire, Coe described the clique of their youth—which included another friend, Matt Elliott—in familiar terms. “We were sort of insular and had a little laugh at everyone else,” she told writer Joseph Stannard, “We were very judgmental about music and decided somehow that we were gonna make music ourselves.”\nIn late-’80s Britain, kids searching for meaning in the sub rosa culture of the underground had a few promising starting points. Nationally, you hadMelody Maker, NME, Sounds, and the rest of the music press that writer Mark Sinker later characterized as a “hidden landscape once a week.” In hisremembranceof the weekly “inkies” of the period, Simon Reynolds described the publications as an “all-enveloping experience that allowed you to escape from your real surroundings, with all their dreary limitations, and achieve vicarious access to the place where all the action was happening and all the ideas were percolating.” In parallel to the treasures found on the newsstands, those with an ear for adventurous sounds tuned in regularly to John Peel’s show on BBC Radio 1. Wright was an avid listener who frequently wrote letters to the host, and she was delighted when he eventually read one of them on the air.\nCoe and Wright’s hometown had a longstanding bohemian tradition and strong musical history. To Americans tuned into what was going on in England at the time, it seemed cool and exotic. “Situated in the pastoral region known as the West Country, Bristol is something like an English San Francisco—as multiracial as London but more laid back,” is how Reynolds described it inThe New York Timesin 1995. He was writing aboutPortishead,Massive Attack, andTricky, the trip-hop triumvirate that, for most, defined the city’s place in music in the decade (honorable mention to junglistsRoni Size& Reprazent). But there was still room to operate in that world’s shadow, and another network of record-obsessed kids was starting to make their way."

Surrounding live performances are soundchecks, joyous greetings from attendees, appearances from Lenker’s dog Oso, and sentimental exchanges with friends. In one snippet, Lenker begins plucking “Now Westlin Winds,” a ballad by Scottish folk singer Dick Gaughan based on Robert Burns’ “Composed in August,” on her guitar. She declares she can’t sing it, then proceeds to recite each verse in full, raising her voice at one point to compete with a motorcycle’s hapless roar. The result is a vivid archive not just of time but also of space—the ephemera orbiting any formal live performance.\nSpace has become a growing fixture in Lenker’s music, in both her work as the clear-eyed lodestar of the folk rock bandBig Thiefand as a solo artist. She recorded 2020’ssongs/instrumentalsstraight to tape in a remote western Massachusetts cabin because itreminded herof “the inside of an acoustic guitar.” A similar process followed for 2024’sBright Future, where a coterie of collaborators joined her in chasing each song’s unfolding in an atmosphere of immediacy. (Two of them, alt-R&B artistNick Hakimand violinist Josefin Runsteen, accompany Lenker for the majority ofLive at Revolution Hall.) In the celestial body of Lenker’s music, songs are flickering instances rather than any kind of fixed point.\nOnLive at Revolution Hall,Lenker partnered with her long-time friend and collaborator, Andrew Sarlo, who refracts those three Portland nights through three different recording formats. Operating as a modern-dayAlan Lomax, Sarlo used a handheld cassette recorder, a four-channel cassette recorder, and a reel-to-reel tape machine to move listeners around: from soundcheck to live performance, from back of the hall to front, from private moments to public ones. “promise is a pendulum,” off Big Thief’sDragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You, begins at practice, crackling with lo-fi atmosphere as though Lenker were in the 1920s auditioning forRalph Peer, then suddenly, seamlessly, gives way to the saturated live version—all luminous color. The most beguiling of these transitions occurs on “anything,” which shifts four times, widening the view to encapsulate the audience’s sing-along, then narrowing it to focus Lenker’s voice, and finally landing at what sounds like the back of the room where the song echoes at a hazy distance."

    "review_text": "Are Brooklyn’sPurelinkaboy band or a jam band? Well, they’re neither; they’re three former Chicagoans making ambient music in the Y2K-eraclicks + cutstradition, yet those faintly disingenuous tags actually say a lot about what sets them apart from their forebears. Guys likeOval,Pole,Jan JelinekandVladislav Delaycarried themselves with modesty, reserve, and dry Northern European humor; they didn’t seem like people you’d necessarily want to have a beer with. Purelink, meanwhile, are the kind of band you’d want tobein: three 30-year-olds with impeccable music taste and even better networking skills, driving south every year to link up with artists likeUllaandHuerco S. at Kansas City’s C- parties.\nThis sense of eagerness and irrepressible youth, the kind you’d associate more with a sparky young rock band likeFrikothan three guys wired into their laptops, shines through on their second album,Faith. They’re not interested in the unreadability and weirdness that led a lot of their predecessors to name their tracks after snippets of data and cryptic non-words. They prefer bright timbres and billowing chords rather than the spaciousness their forebears inherited from dub, cocooning the stereo field in midrange pad noise. The album caps at 38 minutes, far shorter than a CD-era sprawler.\nA lot of this can be attributed to the simple fact that they’re a band; there weren’t a lot of those in the clicks + cuts era. The sunniness of their approach can also be attributed to the way they treat ambient music as something communal, rather than the solitary, private practice of many laptop scientists. While the only guest on their 2023 debut,Signs,was the crypticJ,Faithfeatures a conspicuous appearance fromLoraine James, whose voice imparts a whisper of spliffy trip-hop paranoia on “Rookie,” while on “First Iota,” poetAngelina Nonajmuses on beauty and artifice as guitars slash angrily across the space.\nThat Purelink are so good at replicating the precise sounds of the ’90s and ’00s only emphasizes what differentiates them from their inspirations. Huerco must have passed them some tricks of the trade, because no record since his ownRailroad BluesEP in 2015 better reverse-engineers the pneumatic snapsVladislav Delayperfected on hisfour-album2000run: a sound kind of like a methane bubble escaping an ice thaw, or someone smacking an exercise ball in a diving bell. “Kite Scene” undergirds its reluctant chord plucks with a schaffel beat, foldingWolfgang Voigt’s glam-rock-enamored take on techno into their circle of influences."

    "review_text": "Strange sights have been reported from the shores of Llyn Tegid, also known as Lake Bala, the largest freshwater body in Wales. Lights flicker beneath the surface of the water, and stone spires rise wraithlike from the murky depths—remnants, according to legend, of the castle of Tegid Foel, a wicked ruler whose kingdom was flooded as punishment from the gods. Those who know the folktale will recognize elements of the myth in “Tegid’s Court,” a melancholy highlight ofBibio’sPHANTOM BRICKWORKS (LP II): the harpist who serenaded the court on the night of the king’s fateful final banquet; the birdsong that lured the harpist to higher ground before the floodwaters descended; and faint, mournful voices—the singing of the drowned, perhaps, or a wordless echo of the warning still heard flickering on the wind today: “Vengeance will come!”\nBibio, aka Stephen Wilkinson, has long been interested in recorded sound’s capacity to convey nameless yearning. His best-known music is a gently psychedelic take on folk pop with a layer of nostalgia baked in; the warbly pitches and muted frequencies suggest tapes dredged up from sunken wrecks. (In his commitment to making his music sound eerily like a time-worn relic, he’s a lot like his contemporaryBurial, just raised onNick DrakeandFairport Conventioninstead ofMetalheadzand Renegade Hardware.) ThePhantom Brickworksseries represents the apotheosis of Wilkinson’s nostalgic inclinations, paying tribute to Britain’s landscapes and ruins—crumbling buildings,villages reclaimed by weeds—in wistful, ambient tone poems.\nLike 2017’sfirst installmentof the series,PHANTOM BRICKWORKS (LP II)is an understated affair; it consists of little more than piano, baritone guitar, the occasional voice, and heavy reverb and delay. As on the first album, sketchlike fragments are interspersed with longer, more immersive pieces, but the terrain feels more varied this time around, with more to distinguish one track from the next, whether in terms of timbre, structure, or melody. The aquatic swirl of the opening “Dinorwic,” named for the site of a former slate quarry, recalls the stateliness ofStars of the Lid. The sighing string tones of “Llyn Peris,” named for another lake in Wales, might be an outtake fromAphex Twin’sSelected Analog Works Volume II. The foggy “Brograve,” which shares its title with a dilapidated 18th-century windmill in Norwich, might be one ofPhilip Jeck’s 13-RPM meditations.\nBrian EnoandWilliam Basinskiare patron saints of this music—not just because of its suggestively somber mood and grandly elegiac air, but also for the way Bibio’s loops, at their best, seem to suspend time’s forward march. Like a magician practiced in sleight of hand, he keeps your ears focused on one thing—a particularly plaintive melodic phrase, say—while subtly rearranging everything else in the background. But he seems to be playing loops of different loops against one another. You can hear it in the dissolving counterpoints of “Dinorwic,” or the fuzzy palimpsest of “Phantom Brickworks VI,” in which layer after layer of piano gradually fills in the audio sphere until it appears like a winter sky crisscrossed with contrails. The interaction of all these irregular loops has a curious effect, repetitive but always changing. No two bars are exactly alike, but the shifts are so subtle, it’s impossible to say exactly how they differ. And in that unstable matrix, he holds you rapt."

    "review_text": "In the first moments of Maiya Blaney’s new albumA Room With a Door That Closes, a shivering, sped-up vocal sample threatens to fold in on itself entirely. “You’re my world/And I’m living for you,” it confesses in an unsettling tone, like a demented radio transmission from some distant past. Then the New York-based singer-songwriter collapses the song into clattering breakbeats, sending it into a chaotic, uninhibited groove. Blaney continually pulls off this move on her serpentine, exceptional second album: combining discordant sounds into a tense emulsion until the mixture suddenly ruptures. A mood piece focusing on self-worth in love and life, it reveals Blaney as a perceptive, forward-thinking songwriter, impelling folk, electronic, and alt-rock through hairpin turns.\nA Room With a Door That Closesfinds Blaney changing direction. The earthy neo-soul and silky smooth production of her 2021 debut,3, linger in a few of her new album’s more languorous moments. ButA Room With a Door That Closesalso draws from the same mercurial, scuffed sounds as artists likeTirzahorYves Tumor; here, Blaney casts a flickering light over a dark night of the soul, lifting every jagged rock along the way to see what’s lurking beneath each turbulent emotion. “There are days I’m not alright/Is that okay with you?” she admits on “Could You,” voice dripping with melancholy over a gently rippling guitar. One of several of the album’s quietly crushing ballads, it comes freighted with emotional weight: “I’ll try to make it better,” she assures during the song’s bridge, a promise that grows more insistent and more disillusioned with each climbing octave. On “Honey I,” Blaney conveys a similarly acute sense of loneliness across a delicately curving vocal melody, breakbeats, and electric guitar. It’s a stunning moment of clarity amid the album’s whirling storm.\nBlaney has an all-consuming voice, whether dipped down to an intimate, close-mic’d whisper or blown out into an emphatic howl. Over a waterlogged piano on “Left,” she sounds despondent, slowly building toward the song’s crescendo of squealing electric guitar solos that could have been pulled out of a forgotten ’80s glam-rock gem. “Carmen Electra” is the album’s brashest track, whose nervy grunge-rock sound captures a potent sense of angst. “I don’t relate to fucking them anyway/I don’t relate to, ‘I was just lonely,’” she screeches over blown-out feedback and thrashing drums, giving voice to anger as easily as the sadness she explicated earlier. “Fumbled,” meanwhile, invokesX-Ray Spexat their most electric. The song’s perfectly bratty chorus (“They fumbled the bag!”), shouted over a revving synth, quickly turns into a jittery schoolyard taunt you can’t help repeating right along with her.\nBlaney’s small but meaningful production choices gild the edges of her music in darkened, oxidized colors. The watery cello that circles her voice during “And,” the squall of feedback that rips open “‘Affirmatively’ (Part II),” or the frenetic, synth-heavy outro on the atmospheric “IDR” give movement and cohesion to the album, uniting its disparate threads with a deft touch. On “Recognize Me” a full band backs her for a wobbly indie-rock track about wanting to reboot your life. “When spring hits/You won’t even recognize me,” she sings as the arrangement quickly morphs toward its rafters-reaching bridge: “Don’t want you to recognize me/Not after all this healing.” Like the best moments onA Room With a Door That Closes, the admission leaves you woozily off-balance. But in Blaney’s capable hands, there’s softness to the blow."

Just after the start of this millennium, they were the inland answer to the rise of New York’s sleek rock’n’roll cool, the Kentucky longhairs who harnessed the spirit of their Southern rock predecessors but had panoramic artistic ambitions, too.At Dawnwas a mystical country rock wonder, Jim James’ falsetto cresting like the sun over a canyon.It Still Moveswas the stuff of accidental guitar gods, of a band that nearly broke itself from so much touring but survived long enough to capture at least some of its onstage phosphorescence. AndZbrilliantly answered a question no one else had bothered to ask: What if some posi dudes who knew it waspronounced ‘Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd’also knew what madeRadioheadso compelling? It always seemed fitting that My Morning Jacket’s legendary 2004 performance at Bonnaroo—capturing the lightning of a band sprinting between their two best albums, during a summer downpour—was dubbed “Thunderdome”: My Morning Jacket felt like a fucking power source.\nBut in the 20 years since, as My Morning Jacket has become a respectable institution that hosts and headlines festivals andhometown soirees, anyone who cared has waited in vain for that thrill to return. After self-consciously trying to shirk their Southern ties on 2008’s calamitousEvil Urges, a record once presented as“the album of their lives,”2011’s half-interestingCircuitalwas touted as a “return to form,” a classic stratagem for a band with a flagging vision. A 2015 profile loudly praised that year’s very OKThe Waterfallas their“best album in a decade,” though they’d only made two others. It all felt a little like apologia for middle-aged male mediocrity, hoping for the frisson of youth to return like magic. They’ve since tried three distinct strategies to get back: revisiting years-old recordings on the pleasantThe Waterfall II, snipping and stitching bits of jams into atop-heavy self-titled LP, and, on the declaratively titledis, yielding control for the first time ever to a new-to-them producer, Brendan O’Brien. Alas, the wait continues.\nThe story they’re offering this time around certainlysoundsgood: After infamous struggles with the injuries and indignities of the road, the members of My Morning Jacket have found excitement in mid-40s contentment. “I don’t think we’ve ever felt younger or more alive than we do now,” drummer Patrick Hallahansaidlast year, attributing some of that to sobriety. What’s more, the prospect of working with O’Brien seemed to supercharge them, prompting more than 100 demos in two extended writing sessions. James made rough recordings in his home studio and wrote still more when the band finally rendezvoused with O’Brien at what was once the fabled A&M."

The line resurfaces two songs later on “Have a Nice Time Life!,” suggesting that it might be something like a motto for the duo of Al Nardo and Bailey Wollowitz: Zapping across decades’ worth of brightly colored, hi-def pop tropes as though flicking through channels with the cable remote, fantasy of a broken heart seem to be racing to keep pace with the speed of their ideas.\nNardo and Wollowitz, supporting players withWater From Your EyesandThis Is Loreleiwho first played together inSloppy Jane, assembledChaos Practitionerfrom recordings made at home and brief blasts of creativity on tour. Stitching the pieces together with the assistance of Water From Your Eyes’ Nate Amos, the duo distills the genre-hopping art pop of last October’sFeats of Engineeringinto a dense, restless EP that packs six songs into just 19 minutes.\nThe whiplash pace ofChaos Practitioneris less a visceral sensation than a head trip. fantasy of a broken heart fill every corner of the margins with busy doodles: springy drum programming, processed vocals, strange time signatures, throwback electronics. Nervous overdubs and compulsive countermelodies undercut their fondness for sumptuous soft rock, creating a woozy sway that’s heightened rhythms that skitter around the beat without settling into a groove for long.\nThat velocity can be invigorating. “Passion Clouds” gallops out of the gate with a cheerful, insistent pulse—part motorik, part indie pop—before a zig-zagging rhythm threatens to overwhelm the melody of the chorus. The duo pulls off a similar misdirection on “Victory Path,” submerging the song’s hooks in thick, dissonant layers of lysergic vocoder. They succumb to soft rock on the country-inflected “Road Song,” which sounds like a 4K version of some ofJim O’Rourke’s experiments in classic rock and pop, but even here, they seem determined to avoid anything approaching a straight path. Despite their tuneful inclinations, fantasy of a broken heart are unable to resist the pull of gleeful cacophony; an impish sense of humor runs through their colorful arrangements even when the sentiment—as on “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” a song about toxic relationships—runs much darker.\nSometimes, fantasy of a broken heart appear so intent upon subverting established pop forms that they seem to lack the patience to write a song that ebbs and flows of its own accord. That’s not the case with “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” which retains the spirited energy that drives the EP but eases into a more linear, relaxed groove and draws it out for nearly five minutes—the longest song here by a considerable margin. It feels like a coda to the frenetic explosion of sounds that has preceded it, a satisfying conclusion to an EP that contains more ideas than many records three times its length. After darting from peak to peak across the previous five songs, fantasy of a broken heart finally find the time to slow down and take in the view."

    "review_text": "The latest record bySam Amidonmay be named after one of several Salt Rivers in the US, but the title also captures how hard he can be to classify. His music draws deeply from traditional folk, country, and blues, especially Appalachiana, but it’s too refined to be mistaken for them. It takes in pop reworkings—Mariah CareyandTim McGrawandTears for Fears—but it’s too understated and eccentric to be pop. Not quite a river, not quite the sea, it’s something in between, where Amidon swims around as if trying to find the point where one changes into the other.\nOnSalt River, his lifeguards are Philippe Melanson andSam Gendel. Melanson is a patient, expressive percussionist who plays like someone touching water in different places, then studying the interlocking ripples. Gendel is a jazz saxophonist and producer whose airy intricacies were made for Amidon’s impressionistic songs. And Amidon himself is a nimble picker and fiddler of strings. But above all, there’s that doleful voice, that tattered perfection, with its detached warmth and aloof allure. It has the brass and grit you might hear ringing through a mountain hollow, yet the shine has been rubbed down to matte, the cadences dismantled for study, refitted for the great indoors. It’s what sets Amidon apart from the run of well-turned Nonesuch-core, where “low” traditions such as country and folk are dignified for concert halls with “high” ones like minimalism and jazz, now often goosed with indie rock:Harry SmithmeetsTony Conradin the neighborhood ofBon Iver.\nThis itself is a kind of tradition, and Amidon comes by it honestly. His parents were members of a radical puppet theater that sang on a Nonesuch album of early American folk hymns, and he would later release music on the label himself. Growing up in Vermont, he recorded and performed prodigiously throughout high school and then dabbled in the arty side of indie rock with lifelong collaboratorThomas Bartlett. But since then, he’s mainly staked his name on interpreting rather than creating songs, making himself a vessel that old things can swing through so sweetly and strangely they might as well be new.\nOnSalt River, “Three Five”—exhuming a morbid hymn called “The Old Churchyard”—has everything you’d want in an ideal Sam Amidon song: new-age–adjacent nylon strings flickering darkly and wetly, horns glowing softly as fireflies, percussion that laps and splashes, and Amidon deceptively straining for each interval, missing by strategic degrees. The other big moment is probably “Big Sky,” where he seems to have endeavored to coverLou Reed’s garage-rock singalong as if he wereArthur Russell. Very nice but perhaps a novelty."

    "review_text": "In 2023,Youth Lagoon’s Trevor Powers made something of an archaeological discovery in Idaho: A box of home movies documenting the indie musician’s childhood had been fossilizing in the basement of his parents’ house. Powers popped the tapes into a VHS player and watched his younger self crackle into frame, as an elusive past life—Easter egg hunts, bathtime, backyard laughter—all pranced by in pixels.\nOnRarely Do I Dream,Youth Lagoon’s newest LP, Powers collages these remnants of the past into a sonic scrapbook that sets the Powers clan beside the diner waitresses, devils, and detectives of a fabled American West. This pastiche of myth and memory is as shifty as its source material: Powers nimbly flits between loping piano melodies, shredding guitars, and buzzing synths to score a gothic frontier strewn both with vampires and blood relations. It’s an ambitious undertaking that highlights Powers’ gifts for lyrical microfiction and stirring compositions, with an emotional core that feels fugitive. As Powers harnesses a hard-earned confidence to narrate the world ofRarely Do I Dream, he leaves some of his idiosyncratic vulnerability—a well of raw feeling unmatched by even the most pathos-inducing VHS clips—in the rearview.\nProduced by Powers and collaborator Rodaidh McDonald (who also worked on Youth Lagoon’sHeaven is a Junkyard),Rarely Do I Dreambarrels forward with an outlaw’s velocity. Many of its songs reference Western themes (revolvers, pistols, “Vera Cruzon videotape,” and Jesse James all get mentioned), but its palette transcends geography and genre: The record’s cinematic songs draw from a toy chest of sounds, from prickly arpeggiating synths to outros that evoke steel drums. Tracks like “Gumshoe (Dracula from Arkansas),” “Lucy Takes a Picture,” and “Canary” feel closing-credits-ready, as horns and strings collapse into lingering instrumentals tailor-made for hightailing a stolen Buick through a canyon. Intermittently, Powers’ childhood memories cut in like weak signals on the car radio, spectral and spliced. On the record’s opening track, “Neighborhood Scene,” a male voice, describing the process of transferring 8mm film to VCR, almost sounds like a police dispatcher.\nRarely Do I Dreamcontains some serious guitar shredding, courtesy of longtime collaborator Erik Eastman, and a driving rhythm section. Powers’ prized instrument, however, has always been his peculiar voice, an alien warble capable of communicating trembling uncertainties. OnRarely Do I Dream,he continues to sing with intimate yet unsettling precision, employing past vocal tricks to uncanny effect—the stripped-down track “My Beautiful Girl,” for example, features the same weird syncopation as Powers lent to the phrase“Idaho Alien” back in 2023.Floating above the arrangements, Powers’ voice has a less ragged edge on much ofRarely Do I Dream; he sounds less raw, keening, and isolated, more fluidly integrated into the production. This change has a mixed effect, making the album a smoother listen while sacrificing some of Powers’ characteristic experimentation."

    "review_text": "Darkside’s timing is impeccable. “We’re living in hell,” singsNicolás Jaaron the plainly named “Hell Suite (Part 1).” His calm baritone wafts atop the song’s narcotic waltz, emerging from a flurry of organ and frantic drumming. This moment of eerie calm two-thirds of the way throughNothing, Darkside’s rich and arresting third album, evokes the split second between turning off the alarm on your phone and clocking the gruesome news alerts that popped up overnight.\nThe band seems preternaturally tapped into the collective mood, appearing every few years to confirm what we feel in our bones. Their music is dark and sensuous, vivid as a rainbow in an oil slick. In 2013, when the duo of Jaar and multi-instrumentalistDave Harringtonfirst emerged withPsychic, their pulsing cosmic sprawl was exhilarating, giving the zeitgeist’sdetached, simmeringsynthesizer musica more vital, menacing edge. Looking back, the album feels prescient, its queasy bliss-outs perfectly attuned to the souring of the post-Occupy era. Darkside’s second album, 2021’sSpiral, came as the isolation of COVID lockdowns began to ease. It was a woolier—though no less sinister—version of their slow-burn sound, mirroring the cautious optimism of an apprehensive public yearning for normalcy. It traded the previous album’s neon-lit swirl for a more bucolic approach but otherwise didn’t stray far from the parameters they’d set for themselves, the gravitational pull of a black-hole kick drum shredding every element in its orbit. The songs were brighter and jammier, but the echoing acoustic guitars and gentle pianos felt nauseous, one strobe flash away from a bad-trip panic attack.\nNow, four years later, after expanding to a trio with drummer Tlacael Esparza, Darkside return with another timely and inspired reconfiguration. The world is scarier, reality feels tenuous, and incessant noise fills every waking moment. Instead of 11-minute codeine-disco epics or jangly electronic psych-folk,Nothingleans in a more pop direction, but it’s still warped and corroded. The record wears disgust with the current times on its sleeve, and its unsparing nature feels like a knowing clap on the shoulder. “Look at the window,” sings Jaar on “Hell Suite (Part 2),” his unsettling, warbly falsetto drifting through the pastoral Americana arrangement. “It’s hell out there.”\nThe three musicians started working on new material in 2022 at a rented Los Angeles storefront, relying on an improvisational method they dubbed the Nothing Jam. “It’s a thought experiment for playing music,” Harrington said in arecent interview. “You’re not trying to make anything happen.” The concept of “nothing” was the trio’s guiding light, a mindful idea that freed them from convention, genre, and, most of all, the designs of Darkside past. You can still pinpoint the group’s main signifiers, like Harrington’s guitar pyrotechnics and Jaar’s love of techno, but their palette has expanded. Opener “SLAU” has the slow metabolism of Darkside’s previous work, but it draws more fromKing TubbythanCan. There’s a deeper embrace ofcosmic American music—“Are You Tired? (Keep On Singing)” suddenly bursts into an ecstatic,Grateful Dead-esque jam two minutes in—and the rollicking, “Superstition”-referencing clavinet on “S.N.C.” brings a little funk to their nocturnal thump. There’s also a more pronounced emphasis on texture, some of which can be chalked up to Jaar’s production prowess. But the glitchy, cascading samples at the end of “SLAU” and “Graucha Marx” sound like the work ofSensory Percussion, a system that Esparza developed for his company Sunhouse that turns drumheads into powerful samplers."

    "review_text": "The arc of the golliwog almost comically aligns withbilly woods’ fascination with world history. The racist British caricature was invented in the late 1800s by an American cartoonist working in London, who based it on an old minstrel doll. She co-wrote a dozen children’s books using the figure, which became a hit among English kids and a popular toy. But when she failed to trademark the golliwog, enterprising Brits turned it into a global icon and multiple racial slurs. These days, original versions of the dolls are collectibles that can sell for thousands of dollars. The woods zingers practically write themselves.\nButGOLLIWOG, the Brooklyn rapper’s first solo-billed album sinceTerror Managementin 2019, isn’t the BackwoodzBamboozled. It’s a visionary horrorcore record about the infinite ways people feel and respond to fear. Melding jazz, noise, and ambient, woods uses dread for groggy trips through time and space. The record’s vision of horrorcore, a subgenre enamored with transgressive sex and violence, is psychedelic and dissociative. The new mode intensifies the power of woods’ oration, which has grown more stentorian and dynamic. As he catalogs terrors mundane and extreme, these off-keel songs sway like shadows from a campfire.\nOld collaborators like Steel Tipped Dove,the Alchemist, Messiah Musik, andKenny Segalman the boards, but woods gravitates toward their haziest and loopiest beats. Melodies smother more than they smoothen. Drums patter and fizzle as often as they strike. And there’s rarely drama to the frequent beat switches; the arrangements dissolve rather than combust like those on the similarly atmosphericBRASS. Although many of the songs are built around jagged samples, rhythm is often generated by the interplay between woods’ winding flows and the various layers of instruments and vocal loops. As in a horror flick, the mood is deliberately unsteady.\nwoods has long included bits of fables and fantasies in his music, andGOLLIWOGpushes further into the surreal. The album’s frequent mentions of dreams and fantastical creatures make his imagistic writing even more evocative. “Waterproof Mascara,” set to creeping bass strums and a vocal sample that sounds like a weeping ghost, percolates with unease. “Watched my mother cry from the top of the stairs/Scared when it came through the walls/I covered my ears, half hoping you-know-who would die/Then he did (Surprise!)/Careful what you wish for, you might just get that shit/Moms showed us where she kept the passports hid,” woods raps, repurposing the chorus of 2019’s “Houthi” for the last couplet. He delivers each line with a quiet but building disbelief, as if the narrator too is unsure what is transpiring. The ambiguity of the story, which could be about a haunting or domestic violence, ups the tension."

Of course, their unusually speedy return comes with a catch—as the LP title suggests—that reads like a confession. Mere months ago, singer-guitarist Daniel Bateman and his brother, drummer Steve Bateman, were churning out indie folk and alt-country demos with the same results each time, as if using a weird little cookie cutter that only belonged to them. Confined within this trap of his own making, Daniel Bateman decided to stop trying to break free from his songwriting hallmarks. Instead, he broke out a box of toppings and figured out how to spruce them up.\n1000 Variations on the Same Songisn’t as literal as the title implies; nearly all 11 tracks are different from one another in structure and content. It’s the revision process that challenged Bateman. Articulating his denial and acceptance, he quotes fromThe Wirein album opener “Stillwell”: “You want it to be one way, man.” Is that really so bad? The brain tries to convince you that breaking habits is easy. The self-help section of your local bookstore, however, would like a word. In the song, Bateman dresses up an alcoholic in the language of a salesman—both stuck in cycles, albeit one for relief and the other for profit—to drive home the point over half-hearted piano. “I’m a pro, this ain’t a hobby,” he sings, nodding to the unspoken course of action for both his protagonists and himself:So make it work.\nBateman kept Mozart,Kodak Black, andPrincespinning while writing, but admits the album “doesn’t really sound like any of those”—except when it does. His unbelievably high-pitched falsetto does the heavy lifting in “JUST USE YR HIPS VAR. VI,” turning chunky piano chords into a funk-pop groove just a few steps removed from the 1986 classic “Kiss.” The simple harmonies and giddy tempo shifts in a song like “DOOMSCROLLING VAR. II” draw a line back to classical convention. Frog hold true to their key ingredients, like the brotherly vocal harmonies adding cheer to “DID SANTA COME VAR. IX” and the hiccupping drum pattern that brings momentum to the stripped-down “BLAMING IT ALL ON THE LIFESTYLE VAR. V.” Shortly after that, Frog revive the banjo for “MIXTAPE LINER NOTES VAR.

I could create a narrative about anything right now and as long as I put in minimal effort and make people emotional, the masses will believe it,” he onceposted, in a tone that sounds like he’s alluding to World War III and notLil Yachty’s podcast or whatever.\nThe bit loosely goes back to Edward’s 2023 mixtape,Skeletrix Language, on which 10 of 13 tracks are titled “Typical Rap Song” and another is “Rappéur FW 24 SS 24,” a sort ofPlayboi Cartispoof. Cribbing boilerplate variants of the pyrotechnic rage rap ofYeat’s2 Alivëand mimicking the foaming-at-the-mouth grumble flows you can spot onWhole Lotta Red,Skeletrix Languageis like a mind game. The idea: If he critiques rage, all of the underground rap fans will mindlessly eat up his rage. Got ’em. Maybe I’m giving him too much credit for the master plan, but what makes me think differently is soon afterSkeletrix Languagehe teased a project that never officially materialized,Skeletrix Islvnd Rvdix 66.7,an apparent homage toBlvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6bySpaceGhostPurrp. Purrp was the leader of Raider Klan who, in the mid 2010s, became so disillusioned with the social politics of underground rap that he dedicated his life to social media rants exposing the artificiality of his former friendA$AP Rockyand the star-fucking ecosystem that propped him up, in a way that blurred the lines between emotional breakdown and prank.\nMuseum Musiccould have used a dash of Purrp’s acidic bitterness. It’s mostly one big, cryptic troll job, cloaked by thick layers of irony and variousonlineand real-life stunts, including a Manhattan exhibition that featured Edward Skeletrix motionless inside a glass box. (The show also included art from his friend Brennan Jones, the worst white rapper out, mildly viral forbig-uppingKanye’s praise of Hitler in anattempt to troll; in attendance was Joeyy, the other worst white rapper out, with his own meme-fueled, alt-right-adjacentbackstory.) “I’m a creative director first before anything, that’s my talent. I don’t like making art,” Edwardwrote, virtually deadpan as usual. In my eyes, this statement reads as a send-up of the hollow crap you expect from someone who might have an image from Kanye’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show printed out on their wall like the Last Supper. That’s the kind of person Edward seems to be ribbing on the second side ofMuseum Music."

    "review_text": "On a recent call withThe New York Times, from his home in Saltpond, Ghana,Ebo Taylor, 90 years old next year, struggled to answer questions put to him, relying on his son Henry to do the talking. Taylor suffered a stroke in 2018 that stole much of his ability to communicate in English, and he no longer plays the guitar. It’s natural to consider these obstacles and wonder just how much input the highlife legend had on the new albumEbo Taylor JID022, the latest installment inAdrian YoungeandAli Shaheed Muhammad’s Jazz Is Dead series. Have no fear: Once his voice begins bellowing over the band’s raw, smoky Afro-funk rhythms, it’s clear that the crucial driver of the music is Taylor himself.\nDeroy “Ebo” Taylor’s stature is undisputed. Already a grown man when Ghana gained independence from Great Britain in 1957, he forged his legacy across decades of turbulence, upheaval, and revolution. Taylor’s friendship withFela Kutiepitomized Ghanaian-Nigerian musical exchange even astensions betweentheir two nationstore apart the region, with Fela pushing his collaborator to eschew foreign influence for music of African heritage. Though recorded in Younge’s Linear Labs studio in Los Angeles and bearing its Jazz Is Dead catalog number in its title—a convention that makes the label’s releases seem more like franchise entries than potential classic records in their own right—Ebo Taylor JID022nonetheless succeeds in feeling like a true Ebo Taylor album. Brief at seven songs, only one of which sneaks past the five-minute mark, this is a potent dose of the scintillating Ghanaian highlife sounds he has spent his long career creating.\nThe album comes to life with the palpitating organ line of “Get Up,” signaling for the band—a blend of Ghanaian and American players, including Younge and Muhammad—to build a thick, lush suite; trumpets and trombones hit you from one side, flutes from the other. “Obra Akyedzi” features a rhythmic rush of percussion,waka-wakaelectric guitars, and freewheeling brass. It all clicks together marvellously, opening a portal that sees clear through to the shores of 1970s Accra.\nAt the center of the hurricane is Taylor, mostly singing in his native Akan. It’s reported that the elder Taylor was reliant on his son, a respected player in his own right who performs Fender Rhodes on every song, to interact with producers during sessions. (“Most of my talking in the studio was with Henry,” Younge said.) Nevertheless, Ebo is credited with writing all the lyrics and vocal melodies, and his performance often feels impromptu when compared to the well-drilled musicians, as though summoned from someplace deep within."

    "review_text": "In a more robust market for emotional, guitar-forward rock,Great Grandpa’s 2019 albumFour of Arrowsmight have made the group overnight favorites. Instead, the album found a more gradual, muted reception, earning Great Grandpa a reputation as one of the most underrated bands in emo-adjacent indie rock, as well as the quiet admiration of their peers. Chicago’sRatboysopted to record their 2023 breakoutThe Windowat Seattle studio Hall of Justice in part because Great Grandpa recordedFour of Arrowsthere. It may not be fame, but that’s a nice little legacy, to have someone hear your album and be inspired to make one as wonderful.\nA band can build on that kind of goodwill—provided, of course, that band gets around to releasing a follow-up album, and for a time it seemed possible Great Grandpa might not. Attempts to record new music in 2020 never yielded anything, and by a year later the group had scattered, with singer Al Menne moving to Los Angeles to finish asolo recordand guitarist and primary songwriter Pat Goodwin and bassist Carrie Goodwin starting a family in Denmark. That distance must have been especially painful for this group, judging from how tightly they squeeze together in every press photo, as if any sunlight between them might burn.Big Thiefhas always been the most obvious point of comparison, not only because of their shared overlap of country, grunge, and cosmicality, but because of their closeness as a unit, the suggestion of an unbreakable telepathic link.\nPatience, Moonbeam, the belated follow-up toFour of Arrows, sometimes plays like Great Grandpa’s attempt to reconcile their time apart. “Task,” a sweet and ultimately triumphant account of their reunion, opens with an account of overcoming the initial awkwardness of adjusting to each other’s new lives and identities: “Saw you at a party, we called you by your new name/You had changed, but the heart of you was still the same.” Leaning into those themes of change, Menne transforms and manipulates their voice throughout the record, sometimes blurring it with their bandmates’ backing vocals like smeared charcoal on a canvas, other times obfuscating it with electronics. Their voice can still gut you, but they’ve grown more guarded about unleashing it in its rawest state.\nOne quality that hasn’t changed is the band’s exquisite sense of drama.Patience, Moonbeamis so opulent with strings and splendor it sometimes plays likeMellon Collie and the Infinite Sadnessas rendered on the hangout dramedy scale ofThe Execution of All Things. This group lives for knockout punches, payoffs that propel songs to the next stratum, and they pack the record dense with them. The moonshine-soaked folk jam “Junior” culminates in singalong euphoria, while “Doom” erupts from its immaculate tension with the album’s heaviest riff and stickiest bridge: “It’s funny how I need you,damn.” For all the album’s tenderness and sentimentality, it might make you want to punch a pillow."

    "review_text": "Natalie McIntyre grew up scared to speak. The daughter of a schoolteacher mother and a steel worker stepfather, she was teased throughout her childhood in Canton, Ohio, for her funny voice—a rasp that, no matter how she tried, squeaked like a dog toy. So she retreated into herself, making up songs and thinking of a different life. She didn’t learn to hold a conversation until she was 10 years old. But she was always dreaming. As she tells it, when she was 6 she fell off her bike and landed next to a mailbox. Looking up in a daze, she read the nameMacy Gray. Or maybe there was no bike accident, and the name came from a friend’s father. It’s not important. Either way, as one story goes, Macy Gray soon became a new identity, someone who wrote stories and songs—someone who, Natalie imagined, people would listen to. (It’s beside the point that the real Macy Gray was an old man who, once Natalie adopted his name as her own, would later attempt to extort her.)\nNatalie was undeniably gifted, having begun classical piano at age 7; a loner in high school, she read Angela Davis and watched movies by John Cassavetes. After graduating high school she moved to Los Angeles to study screenwriting at USC. Her early musical career was a series of false starts: Surprised that the great embarrassment of her youth could be considered a gift, she wrote songs with friends, filled in vocals on demos and sang in jazz clubs, her voice not yet a superpower but no longer a liability. Now officially embodying the persona of Macy Gray, she partied hard, played any open mic or gig offered to her in hotel lobbies or on the Sunset Strip, and fell in with a group of musicians. She helped run a club called the Wee Ours where Mos Def and the Roots hung out. She sent her demos to labels and worked random jobs. She idolizedBillie Holiday, but, as she later toldThe New Yorker, for all the wrong reasons: “I wanted to die young and go on drugs and all that shit.” She met a mercurial mortgage broker named Tracy Hinds and fell in love.\nIn 1994, an A&R from Atlantic heard the 25-year-old Gray play at the Roxy and signed her. The next part depends on who tells it: whether it was because she got pregnant or because the A&R left the company, Atlantic dropped Gray and shelved her debut, a traditional rock album calledA Thing of Beauty. Three years later—reeling from a disastrous divorce from Hinds—she gave up hopes of making it and shuffled back to Canton to live with her mother and three children. Then the call came. Jeff Blue, the A&R from Zomba Music Publishing responsible for discovering Limp Bizkit and Korn (your guess is as good as mine), had heard her demo and, floored by Gray’s voice, wouldn’t stop calling until he convinced her to give a career in music another shot. With a family to feed and a lingering desire to keep performing, she gave in—someone, for some reason, wanted to hear what she had to say. It was the last time she’d live in Ohio."

Her sets shift quickly and dramatically, blending ’90s German dance duo Tokyo Ghetto Pussy into a sped-up version of “SexyBack” that makesJustin Timberlakesound like Mickey Mouse. Her breakout hit, “My Barn, My Rules,”caused controversy in 2023when a BBC Radio 1 host announced on air that she hated it. On horsegiirL’s newV.I.P - very important ponyEP, the half-woman, half-horse DJ traverses hardstyle, Eurodance, and happy hardcore, balancing sophisticated technique with silliness.\nThough Eurodance was never noted for lyrical prowess, horsegiirL has a gift for incorporating winking references to equine lifestyles and pop music history. “I like diamonds and big checks, private islands, rich sex,” she coos on “materiaL hor$e,” collidingMcBlingbaddie lyrics from thepost-Ayesha Eroticaworld of pop with the tongue-in-cheek materialism ofMadonna’sclassic. Maybe it’s commentary and maybe it’s not, but in any case it’s chic—bassy on the low end, adorned with cutesy bells and the sound of popping bubbles on top. In other hands the song might feel parodic, but onV.I.P - very important pony, life as a horse-human is nothing if not glamorous.\nWhat horsegiirL’s DJ sets share with her original tracks is the breadth of ground covered. In an interview withMixmag, she professed her appreciation for ghettotech, donk, mákina, Jersey club, and more; her Rolodex of references shines through the music. Across the EP, she blends in and out of genres at breakneck speed while still leaving breathing room. “bby luv x3” is a dexterous balance of delicate vocals and a thunderous hardstyle breakdown that doesn’t allow any layers to get lost in the mix. The desire to seriously explore dance subgenres often written off as cheesy is nothing new—hyperpop-adjacent internet scenesters like909worldwideandMoistbreezycome to mind, as doesDanny L Harle—but horsegiirL’s approach stands out for how many styles she’s able to pull together without letting any become a punchline.\nThe space she allows each musical moment adds up to a world that feels far bigger than the EP’s 13 minutes; it’s something more akin to the spontaneous magic that comes with hearing a DJ perform live. horsegiirL joins the ranks of masked electronic musicians who’ve set out to create artistic personas without attaching a human face. Luckily,V.I.P - very important ponyis enough fun that the horse head starts to seem like it’s not the thing that makes her special."

    "review_text": "Just shy of a century before six lifelong friends with a boatload of instruments and just as much talent came together asDutch Interior, Spanish artist Joan Miró put his own spin on Dutch Golden Age paintings by reinterpreting naturalistic depictions of everyday life as surrealist abstractions. The Los Angeles band chose to name itself after Miró’s series, and the rest was history. Whether or not it’s a direct wink at their MO, the name is apt: Throughout their discography, Dutch Interior have consistently channeled a variety of influences into what they call “freak Americana.”Moneyballis their most wide-ranging, thoughtfully realized album, leaving the band’s own pins all across the map of the American songwriting tradition.\nUntil now, Dutch Interior claim to have been mostly winging it: They’vesaidtheir 2021 debut,Kindergarten, “just kind of fell out of us”; 2023’sBlinded by Famecame together in a literal garage, unburdened by any kind of expectations. The laid-back, lo-fi qualities of those records contrast markedly with the folk and country of the more expansively producedMoneyball, where the stated influences are so intentional, at times it seems as if they posed specific creative prompts to challenge themselves. “Wood Knot” came about because they wanted to write a “three chordNeil Youngsong with a Sparklehorse bassline.” Single “Sandcastle Molds” was intended to be a “fucked upFleetwood Macsong.” And while the results of these experiments can be uneven at times, they form something impressively singular in its sprawl.\nMoneyball’s generous instrumentation lets the band get creative with a bigger and bolder sound, cycling between seven different types of guitar, pedal steel, banjo, two basses, piano, four synths, and more—plus an EBow, mixer drone, and even screwdriver, à laGodspeed You! Black Emperor. Five of the six players sing, and they all share songwriting credits, testifying to the sense of creative free-for-all behind their stylistic leaps. In any other context, it’d be strange to imagine that a song like “Life (So Crazy),” driven by a moody bassline andJ Mascisrasp, might be followed by the lovesick pedal-steel-and-piano twang of “Horse” only two songs later. But they pull it off by fine-tuning the elements across each song—more like EQing a mix than assembling a compilation.\nSome zigzags feel more like dead ends. After album opener and slow-burn stunner “Canada,” “Sandcastle Molds” breaks the mood; the rollicking drumbeat, nervous blues licks, and dissonant climax feel muddled and a little overdone when compared to some of their more relaxed songs. But the next few tracks get the album back on solid footing; “Wood Knot” succeeds in incorporating a folksier sound and really getting Neil Young with it, and the dissonant alien strings on “Science Fiction” beam us up into full orchestral orbit.\nUltimately, the biggest part ofMoneyball’s charm is its evident sincerity. The band members have spoken at length about their friendship and the ease with which their music comes together, and that feeling of camaraderie spills into the album’s themes of hope and human connection. Even in their most heartbroken moments, songs never lapse into jadedness; on the tragic, waltzing “Beekeeping,” the narrator’s biggest regret is that he “could’ve shared so much more.”\nIn an era of endemic disaffection, it can feel shamefully corny to tell ourselves to be there for each other—that love wins; we should enjoy the little things; “laugh like we were meant to,” as they sing on the hushed “Life (So Crazy).” But corniness is no crime, and Dutch Interior’s willingness to inch close to the cob is disarming.Moneyballmay not tread new territory in its subject matter (loving your friends, feeling at home—has anyone ever done this?), but the band still finds fresh, teasingly ironic ways to frame even the most hackneyed sentiments: “Home sweet home,” they sing on “Wood Knot,” following the melancholy contour of a pedal steel: “Live laugh love/Plant my ass/Deeper than a root.”\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Marylou Mayniel might be a traditionalist at heart. “I’ve gotten tired of the internet,” she recentlytoldCrack—striking news for the singer and producer whose first release asOklou, 2020’sGalore, made her name (pronounced “OK, Lou”) among a certain sect of the terminally online. A classically trained French musician turned London club kid, Mayniel makes electronic pop with the rigor and meticulousness of a Bach cantata. Her debut album,choke enough, is a foggy, twilit fusion of Y2K worship and medieval melodicism, withA.G. CookandDanny L Harlejoining longtime co-producer Casey MQ behind the boards. At once jacked into the mainframe and lost in the wilderness, the record casts Oklou as a cipher in her own music; even as we hear her, we never really know her.\nAs a founding member of NUXXE, the label and collective that has come to define a certain “art schoolers go to Berghain” sound, Mayniel stood out among her contemporaries for her relative reserve: neither as sensual asEartheaternor as bawdy asShygirl.Galoresongs like “fall” and “god’s chariots” were puckish and subtle, built on little more than acid-synth arpeggios and the occasional drum loop. Last year, though, I saw Oklou perform in a seventh-story walkup on the Lower East Side. Watching Mayniel’s hands dance nimbly across the keyboard, assembling loops in real time, each instrument—even the guitar she sheepishly picked up to play the then-unreleased single “Blade Bird”—felt like an extension of her person. This, it appeared, must be the world’s most charming cyborg.\nOnchoke enough, that highly skilled performer comes into her own as an artist. The title track is easily Oklou’s best to date, channeling the muffled ambience of a “you’re in the bathroom at a party” video through four minutes of metamorphic trance. In the absence of a four-on-the-floor rhythm, its shifting synth timbres create the effect of a sculpture viewed from different angles, a quality of constantly becoming—yet never quite reaching—shared across most of the songs here. Album opener “Endless” unfurls from a distant hemiola to a misty ballad to a charmingly hesitant keyboard solo: a lone oboe preset that wanders into the mix before almost self-consciously ceding the spotlight back to Mayniel.\nUncanny textures abound. On “Thank You for Recording,” Oklou and her synth flute trade melodies like a cyberpunk Disney princess duetting with the robot bird perched on her finger. The arrangement harkens back to Prokofiev’sPeter and the Wolf, a symphony for children in which each instrument stands in for a different character. Mayniel’s conservatory background crops up throughoutchoke enough, specifically in her fondness for imitative polyphony, a hallmark of Baroque composition where melodic lines are shared between multiple instruments. The sugar rush of “Ict” boasts a trumpet refrain that plausibly could’ve been written during the 1600s, and the digi-clarinet and tambourine of “Obvious” are straight out of a Renaissance fair. In Oklou’s hands, hyper-quantized digital beats make natural counterparts to the equally precise music composed centuries earlier."

    "review_text": "As a precocious youth,Jerry Garciafound escape through painting, studying the Bay Area figurative style of abstract art. Late in life, it was scuba diving, acquainting himself with the ocean floors of Hawaii, petting octopuses and eels, setting a world record for the longest time spent underwater. But when he was turning 30, all Jerry wanted to do was play pedal steel. You can hear the fruits of his exploration between the years of 1969 and 1974 all over live recordings fromthe Grateful Dead, on guest appearances on classics by friends like Jefferson Starship and CSNY, and throughout the early catalog of New Riders of the Purple Sage, a band started with the express purpose of honing his skill in collaboration.\nBut if you really want to hear what Jerry Garcia could do with the pedal steel, listen to “The Wheel.” It’s the closing track of 1972’sGarcia, among the most beautiful four minutes of music in his vast catalog. Bursting to life from a discordant jam, the cyclical folk song feels like adjusting to new visibility under the sea. Seesawing between buoyant major chords, with Garcia’s vocals layered in tight coils of harmony, his pedal steel guides the way, untrained but masterful, exuding a joy that radiates from the speakers, even 50-plus years later.\nAt the time of its release, Jerry distinguished his debut solo album from his previous work by being “completely self-indulgent.” Think about this for a second. This is an artist who made fine art of self-indulgence. He reshaped the modern rock concert in his own sprawling, unhurried image; he played guitar solos like nobody has, before or since, largely based on lyrical motifs that felt designed to drift effortlessly forever; he admitted to viewing studio albums—those old-school totems of discipline and meaning—as a “necessary evil” to function within an industry he loathed; he led a band who would develop a setlist staple composed entirely of drum solos and prolonged ambience.\nSo, what was different this time? For one thing, it happened in a flash. The bulk of the music—developed through improvisations between Garcia on acoustic guitar and his Dead bandmate Bill Kreutzmann on drums, with lyricistRobert Hunterscribbling away in a corner—happened in roughly the span of a week. After just 21 days, the whole record was sequenced, mixed, and handed over to the label. Soon, he’d be back on the road with the Dead, playing the legendary shows that would be documented on the extraordinary live albumEurope ’72. Coming after the band’s twin peaks ofWorkingman’s DeadandAmerican Beauty, both released in 1970 and both succeeding in pushing the group beyond cult fame into wider acceptance, Jerry’s solo music did little to embellish the winning streak he was already on."

    "review_text": "OnBossman Dlow’s breakout hit, he couldn’t help but lie. “I’m driving the Bentley Bentayga like I don’t love my life,” he boasted on “Get in With Me,” which would eventually be included on last spring’s freewheelingMr Beat the Road. An evocative image, but a preposterous one coming from someone who frequently sounds like the happiest rapper on the Earth. The Florida native, whose style most directly evokes the careening, comical Michigan rappers of the late 2010s, seems to love it all: the bloggers and lovers nattering in his phone, the rice that’s shifted from diet staple to overpriced steakhouse side dish, the $6,000 shoes he can only wear once (they hurt his feet).\nHis new record, last month’s buoyantDlow Curry, is defined by this delirious consumption: half-million-dollar cars full of ash and fleets of black trucks waiting to pick him up at the airport, dope-stained kitchenware on marble countertops, extra-friendly Neiman Marcus valets, cologne and belts and Cuban links and, on “Mo Chicken,” more chicken. It’s ravenous. Dlow uses all of these goods and services to illustrate a world that has high stakes, but only in the way Looney Tunes has high stakes—you picture the cops on his tail pancaked flat against a mural of a street, the women at his club appearances with hearts popping out of their eyes and steam coming from their ears.\nDlow Curryis effective in part because its shape is the perfect vessel for Dlow’s style. Its 20 songs clock in at just under 50 minutes, tracks often cut off before a second full verse, and the tempo never lags. For some writers with limited subject matter, this would invite redundancy. But Dlow is such an expressive vocalist that each blown red light and grimacing mall security guard sounds as if it’s his very first. And so, when the purely consumptive lines, or the otherwise circular boasts about hustling, are joined by Dlow’s favorite motif—begging a coach to put him in the game to win for his team—his record has a momentum, even desperation, that makes the glee feel cathartic.\nHis sense of economy applies in the micro, too. Dlow is not quite a master of the clipped, epigrammatic style of earlyJeezy—a close analogue given his exhortations of listeners—but he occasionally approaches that level. “Any time the crackers run up, I run,” he raps on “The Biggest Pt. 2.” “Any time the crackers lock me up, I post bond.” (On the chorus of “Dlow Gucci,” he sums up his exceptional life succinctly: “Baby, I ain’t normal.”) Short as the songs tend to be, they seem primed to be diced into even smaller components—Instagram captions, 10-second videos, the shards of larger artworks that are reassembled into the digital wallpaper of our lives.\nMaybe that explains the runaway popularity of a rapper who, while almost endlessly charismatic, is not exactly writing classical pop songs. What’s most impressive, though, is that in the context of a full album, these brief glimpses of the hilarious or magnetic are synthesized into a frenetic blur that mirrors Dlow’s whole ethos. It’s easier to get lost inDlow Currythan the immediacy of its songs might suggest. All the outlandishness comes to feel natural, intuitive, even if it isn’t exactly the truth.\nCorrection:Bossman Dlow’s hometown is Port Salerno, not Tallahassee. This review has been updated."

    "review_text": "True Musicmay be homespun and cozy, but don’t call it bedroom pop.Zach Phillips’ new solo tape was recorded after midnight in his Brooklyn apartment, and it sounds like it: full of incidental creaks and the sleepy hum of the neighborhood. His piano—the only instrument on the album, aside from an odd synth solo—is dampened by the practice mute pedal, and Phillips’ singing is courteously hushed. A laptop mic overhears it all, committing the performance straight to Audacity, a free, bare-bones recording software. In the DAW era, bedroom pop, even at its fuzziest, can feel sterile or uncanny; Phillips’ apartment, by contrast, sounds economical and connected to the world outside. His new batch of miniatures feels both lived-in and alive, each song searching for the sublime in quotidian reflections on the recent past.\nPhillips worked onTrue Musicto decompress in the weeks leading up to the release ofRong Weicknes, his third full-length outing as co-bandleader ofFievel Is Glauque. Since the release ofGod’s Trashmen Sent to Right the Messin early 2021, Fievel’s dense, jazz-adjacent approach to pop songcraft has garnered a devoted cult of young fans hungry for the eccentric harmonic language of artists likeGeordie GreepandJack Stauber. WhileTrue Music’s spare production is an intentional contrast to the meticulous design of the band’s work, it’s also a return to a creative mode more familiar to those who collected the solo tapes Phillips released on his now-defunct OSR label. The songs here are extemporaneous and loose, capturing the ideas (harmonic and emotional) occupying his head before falling back to sleep.\nTrue Music’s most poignant writing celebrates the pleasures of hanging out. On “It Made My Night,” Phillips looks back on a riveting conversation with a friend, marveling at the dialog’s shape and effects. The song’s first half depicts the interlocutors as improvisers, noting how their back-and-forth made him “find the wildest things to say before [he] thought them; in the second half, Phillips lets his right hand respond, rattling off delicate melodies as if racing to the punchline of a joke. “Timeless Wonders of the World,” a whimsical tale of a deceased musician who descends from heaven to grill out with the boys, is sung over spasmodic left-hand rhythms and tertiary harmonic colors. As the short story jumps between tenses in its own curious dream logic, Phillips’ playing does the same: It’s slightly dissonant, but not in an eerie way. Melodic phrases crowd around odd chord voicings, then scurry back into hiding before Phillips drifts in and out of a key change. As with “It Made My Night,” the track’s brief instrumental solo serves as a payoff, unraveling the tension to let a gorgeous flow of notes rush in."

    "review_text": "Some years ago, my boyfriend invented what I believe to be the greatest dinner party game of all time. Ideally meant for drunken shouting across a large table, “Real Freak/Fake Freak” distinguishes between true weirdos and well-adjusted people who wear their eccentricities likea bag of chips on their heads. You begin with universal claims (Brian Wilson, RIP, was a Real Freak;Frank Zappawas a Fake Freak) and progress until everyone feels emboldened to try to outdo one another. These fights can range from the historical (Yoko Ono: RF/The Beatles: FF), to the controversial (Courtney Love: RF/Kurt Cobain: FF), to the ones that would get you murdered by Brazilian teenagers online (Redacted/Redigido), going on until you’ve exhausted your vocal cords from screaming with or at each other. There is nothing inherently good or bad about being a freak, but the game does speak to how an audience squares life and art, and how convincing a musician can be at phrasing their humanity through their strangeness.\nGiven her goofy stage persona and children’s-party-on-acid aesthetic, Angel Abaya readily invites this question. She started off playing things relatively straight, performing with bands in Idaho, working for local arts organizations, and releasing an album of dusky folk rock under hergovernment name. But after moving to Los Angeles and linking up with Sean Guerin ofDe Lux, she underwent a major makeover. AsGelli Haha, the singer stakes a claim to the club’s weird corners, marrying disco and house-pop to a strain of surreal humor that hews closer toPeeWee’s Playhousethan to polyester genre imitation. OnSwitcheroo,Gelli Haha’s new album, she raises a big top large enough to contain stoned revelation, gross-out humor, and a stockpile of bizarro sound effects. With its riotously fun production and full-barreled commitment to silliness,Switcheroodoes more than earn its freak card: It firmly establishes Abaya as a brilliant young talent to watch.\nContrary to her stage name, Abaya is less interested in being funny (haha) than she is in using disco’s pull and release to dance this mess around. Her songs are panoramic in an off-kilter way, tracing odd circles around fraught feelings without ever leaving the dancefloor. Opener “Funny Music” considers the psychological push and pull of being a clown in the form of a dialectic—more enjoyable than it sounds! Over a surging Moroder beat, the artist alternates between a heartfelt yearning to be laughed at and soft-spoken disavowals that she’s only joking. As the song builds to a climax, she puts her foot down firmly on the side of sincerity by making a massive, aching arch out of the plea: “I’mfunnyyyyyy!” The desperation is unmistakable, but so too is the message: She may be weird as hell, but from here on out, defensiveness will have no place in Gelli Haha’s universe."

    "review_text": "WhenJane Removersurprise-dropped “JRJRJR,” the sky screamed with the last fireworks and a sulfurous haze hung in the air. It was midday on January 1, 2025, and the song felt something like a war cry—instilling fear in enemies and glee in digicore OGs. And if you thought the glitch-wracked “JRJRJR” was overwhelming, then brace yourself for the apocalyptic “Psychoboost.” Named after an attack move associated with the Pokémon Deoxys, this song hits like a laser shooting through your brain. In the video game’s lore, Deoxys spawned from an alien virus that descended from outer space—I wouldn’t be surprised if the same scenario brought usRevengeseekerz. Rather than continue with the dustbowl shoegaze and soft balladry ofCensus Designated, the album does a complete 180. This is some of the most all-out intense music they’ve ever made, an inferno of raw thoughts that pushes everything—rap, pop, voice, their artistic persona—to the breaking point.\nWhat kind of revenge is being sought here? Maybe revenge against industry shenanigans, revenge against people trying to see Jane fail, revenge against the world. Or maybe this is revenge without a referent, revenge as a state of mind. There are so many reasons to be defensive as an artist now, especially one with a very online, parasocial fanbase. Revenge is like an attack stance, a vehicle to talk their shit and go berserk. Jane’s singing and screaming, shapeshifting and sinning, telling haters who dare speak ill to kill themselves. They’re spamming Palkia battle cries and comparing themselves toAvril Lavigne. “Three years ago I could’ve touched a million/Three years ago I had that magic in my hand,” Jane declares at the start, knowing they’ve struck it again.\n“Hyper” and “maximal” aren’t enough to describe the extreme overload here. It reminds me of the way a computer with a low-level GPU shudders while straining to render something high-res. The flash-fire finale to “Professional Vengeance” erupts like a motherboard under magma. Sprees of giddy rap bleed into EDM pop with layers and sublayers of screams that ripple into pure noise. Every empty inch is thronged with chants and record scratches and video game samples that sound like personal heirlooms. It captures the same live-time thrill I get listening to Jane’sleroy mashup tapesandNTS sets—a wonderfully unpredictable anarchy. “Experimental Skin” judders so frenetically it sounds like they recorded the song and then let five DJs tweak it out by jitter-clicking every button at once. It’s hard to fathom that just two months ago Jane released an album ofpatiently unfurling rockunder an alt account."

    "review_text": "The history of the ginger root in West Africa is deceptively brief. Introduced by Portuguese traders in the 1700s, the peppery rhizome became a cornerstone of Nigeria’s regional cuisines, export economy, and slang. To be “gingered” by someone—as David Adedeji Adeleke often finds himself—is to be exhilarated, invigorated, turned on.Davido’s blend of Afropop, R&B, and lovers rock is tailor-made for eye contact across the dancefloor and tumbling into bed in the same night. On5ive, his fifth studio album, the Nigerian pop superstar surveys the empire he helped build and hungers for more, casting himself as a Biblical David who “meets his Goliath with a melody all his own.” If that sounds weighty after the nonstop celebration of 2019’sA Good Time, fear not; this is still Afrobeats’ preeminent loverboy.5iveis an intoxicating breath of ocean air and amor fati that thrives on Davido’s magnetic confidence and only falters when he seems to doubt his own star power.\nWhenJustin Bieberdropped a verse onWizkidandTems’ humid duet “Essence” in summer 2021, white smoke may as well have billowed from the proverbial chimney: Just as reggaetón hadconquered the chartsduring the second half of the 2010s, this would be the dominant pop sound of the nascent decade. While Afrobeats has since spawnedglobalstarsand been a frequentpointofreferencefor Western hitmakers likeDrake, contemporary Nigerian pop as it was ushered in by the likes of Wizkid and Davido (who share a longstanding rivalry) remains largely undiluted: log drums tango with bouncy synth bass and highlife guitars glide across leisurely dembow rhythms, all at about 100 to 120 beats per minute.5iveoffers several exemplary additions to the canon, including the amapiano-inflected “CFMF” and lead single “Awuke,” a link-up with Jamaica’s YG Marley that floats along on a nearly wordless chorus, save the line “You don finish me with love.”\nMarley sits among a roster of international guests in an apparent effort to boost Davido’s worldwide notoriety.Victoria Monétis a capable sparring partner, trading seductive taunts over nocturnal, Lite-Brite alté on the stunning “Offa Me.” But the presence ofChris Brownon “Titanium” sours the mood. Nigeria’s music industry is, by and large, male-dominated, and the three women who appear on5ive—Monét,Becky G, andShenseea—hail from Atlanta, Inglewood, and Jamaica. One wishes Davido had opted to share his own A-list shine with more of the homegrown talent, whose presence is a highlight throughout. “Funds,” featuring Nigerian artists ODUMODUBLVCK and Chike, revisits the free-spending playboy of “Fall”—still Davido’sdefinitive song—with a promise to “mismanage my funds on you.” And “With You,” the closing track, weaves singer Omah Lay seamlessly into one of the album’s luscious vocal arrangements.\n“With You” is livelier and more electrically charged than any song that precedes it, which likewise could be said of this whole record. Davido’s last couple of releases—A Better Timein 2020 andTimelessin 2023—rounded out the trilogy he began withA Good Time, but they could trend somber, even reserved. Not so on5ive, which is all zing, all ginger, full of regal proclamations that “People talk, people talk/But nobody fit fill me position” and that after “12 years I’m still on top.” Tracks like “Holy Water” and “Tek” are subtler displays of dominance, as Davido presides over slinky bangers constructed from, respectively, beatboxed percussion and an interpolation of the “Careless Whisper” sax solo. Having reached Afrobeats’ highest echelons, Davido’s David and Goliath metaphor might be due for a replacement: By now, the crown is his for the taking.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

In physical space, there are just over 150 miles between the tree on the cover of1000 Gecs(543 E Algonquin Rd., Des Plaines, IL) and the house on the cover of the firstAmerican Footballalbum(704 W High St., Urbana, IL). It might take you less than three hours to drive from one to the other if you don’t get stuck in Chicago, where three major interstates knot together.Jane Removergrew up in New Jersey, not Illinois, butin 2023 they talked about moving to Chicago, and anywaymost American interstices share a common parlance. The only highway Remover mentions on the first album they’ve made under the nameventuringis I-15, which courses from San Diego up through Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City before terminating in a town called Sweet Grass at the northern edge of Montana. In 2020, 65 people lived in Sweet Grass. On their 2021 track “Seventeen,” Jane Remover sang, “Wish I could escape this shitty place.” It’s easy enough to escape a place, harder to ditch the shit. AsJason Molinasang onan album he recorded in Chicago, “Why put a new address on the same old loneliness?”\nNearly four years ago, Jane Remover’s first full-length recordFrailtyheralded a watershed moment in the amorphous, emergent subgenre that some people agree is called digicore. That album rendered its huge teenage feelings with corroded digital artifacts stacked high, never drawing much juice from any one sound in particular, but drinking deep from the contrasts between them. The 2023 follow-upCensus Designateddove into whatRemover called “straight up rock,”casting their singing voice as a weight-bearing pillar for the first time amid tectonic shoegaze guitars. Last year, a chain of vibrant singles like “Flash in the Pan” and \"Magic I Want U\" emphasized the bright, spiky hip-hop strains of Jane Remover’s DNA.Ghostholding, by contrast, tracks back to the midwestern emo marriage of snaking guitar riffs and melodic, introspective singing, with occasional shoegaze blasts interspersed for good measure. It’s an album full of sprawling, fearsome beauty, both compositionally tighter and texturally coarser than Remover’s past forays into rock.\nGhostholdingfurthersCensus Designated’s fascination with the long open road and the empty space all around it. “There’s so many places, especially the Pacific Northwest, where there’s just so much vast nothingness, and that’s really beautiful and I wanted to capture that,”Remover toldThemin 2023. “I was all over the country/Didn’t even want to go back home,” they sing on album opener “Play my guitar.” The decidedly emo setting proves to be a springboard for the most daring vocal melodies they’ve written. Remover ripples their syllables way out across measures likePerfume Genius’ Mike Hadreas and flips registers in quavering yodels as eagerly asthe Cranberries’ Dolores O’Riordan. Their newly showcased vocal athleticism heightens the surreal intimacies of their lyrics. When they ask, “I believe everything, do you believe in me?” on “Believe,” it feels like all the time left in the world hangs on whether the answer is yes."

    "review_text": "American instrumental guitarists often conjure sprawling frontiers, but those visions can confine them.William Tyler, among the tradition’s preeminent 21st century practitioners, has a diverse catalog—he’s released a rolicking, jammyrock LP; backed his trusted Martin acoustic withdelicate brass; and let out billows of vaporous feedback on hissolo recordings. Yet his relentlessly tuneful approach, which seeks serene resolution, and his geographical inspirations—whether muggy Tennessee or the sun-dried Southwest—mean his music is always a hair’s breadth from sentimentalizing American dreams that he wants to interrogate. With the nation in free fall and everyone’s horizons narrowing, Tyler has tempered his optimism: The 45-year-old’s latest, the hauntingTime Indefinite, includes a dimmed palette and a downcast scope. The shift makes for his most ambitious full-length yet.\nTime Indefiniteis still steeped in the American mythos, but this time the focus is on small remnants of life, not sweeping evocations of wide expanses. Tyler incorporates found sound, notably from a reel-to-reel he discovered while combing through his late grandfather’s belongings in Jackson, Mississippi. The machine’s damaged whirring and Tyler’s waltzing, Victrola-ready melodies recall British ambient iconthe Caretaker, known for digging up pre-World War II big-band recordings and layering them into faded, postmodern palimpsests. ButTime Indefinitereaches for an atmosphere that’s a bit closer to home. It often feels like a television tuned to a religious station on Christmas, glowing and murmuring with speech and song after everyone has drifted off to sleep.\nThe LP’s 48 minutes are filled with tiny snatches of AM-style theme music, inaudible intonations, God-fearing hymns, and mechanical racket, and swathed in ghostly, deteriorating production that suggests these warped snippets have lasted into a post-cataclysmic future. Voices echo on several inclusions, the garbled speech of the long dead. The wind whistles on “The Hardest Land to Harvest,” as though through a barren, apocalyptic landscape. Tyler plays archaeologist of the modern era, imagining how elements of today’s society could one day become relics.\nSurprisingly, his preoccupation with impermanence and mortality isn’t exactly somber—often, it spotlights a hard-won sense of hope. Tyler uses major-key guitar melodies judiciously, instead of sprinkling them throughout, which makes their shapes more memorable: After the blown-out tape distortion of opener “Cabin Six,” his six-string enters at the start of “Concern” like morning sun through a window. Acoustic strumming blends with gaping maws of synthesizer on “Anima Hotel”; the central guitar figure on “Howling at the Second Moon” grows into an unexpected string accompaniment. Tyler’s discography has been so consonant, andTime Indefinitecould only seem grating in comparison. In fact, it’s a narrative, transformative work whose deserts of noise set its staggering peaks in relief."

    "review_text": "Have you been in a prominent but underappreciated indie rock band within the past 15 years? Does your musical expertise include Cristal Baschet, fiddle engineering, or “ambient sculpture?” Have you ever been favorably reviewed by this website? If you answered “yes” to one or more of these questions, you might be onMiley Cyrus’ new album.\nSomething Beautiful, Cyrus’ follow-up to her 2023 LPEndless Summer Vacation, features acredit rosterthat rivals the length of this review. It is a concept album without a concept: “My idea was makingThe Wall, but with a better wardrobe and more glamorous and filled with pop culture,” Cyrus toldHarper’s Bazaarlast fall. Executing that vision, however thin, required an army of indie rock vets:Foxygen’sJonathan Rado,Alabama Shakes’Brittany Howard,the War on Drugs’Adam Granduciel,Nick Hakim,Alvvays’ Molly Rankin and Alec O’Hanley,Yeah Yeah Yeahs’Nick Zinner,the Lemon Twigs’ Brian D’Addario, andHaim’sDanielle Haim, just to name a few. Cyrus executive-producedSomething BeautifulwithShawn Everett, who also plays a number of instruments on the 13-track album—a tonally confused entry in Cyrus’ catalog that lurches between hi-fidelity art rock and soggy, warmed-over pop. Directionless and thematically vague, it starts with a bang and ends in a whimper.\nCyrus released “Prelude” and “Something Beautiful” as the album’slead singles, a choice as misleading as making them the opening tracks. They areSomething Beautiful’s best songs, and the only pieces that audibly justify Cyrus’ sprawling team of collaborators. Though their initial presentation was laughably “high concept” (in both music videos Cyrus preens about in archival couture), the songs themselves contain the most interesting arrangement and production Cyrus has ever recorded to. “Prelude,” co-written byCole Hadenof New York experimental groupModel/Actriz, is partTangerine Dreamsci-fi score, part spaghetti Western overture, recorded with a dizzying amount of equipment: Moog, Fairlight CMI, saxophone, violin, Barr-Fox Wurlitzer Theater Organ, cello, viola, Minimoog. Cyrus does her bestLaurie Andersonimpression atop the layered arpeggios; spooling out stoic but evocative spoken word, her voice is slightly mottled, as if coated in fine ash. It almost works, except for the clumsy, inflated language (“Like when following an image from a train/Your eyes can’t keep the passing landscapes from being swallowed into endless distance”)."

    "review_text": "Isn’t it a little fun, sometimes, to be sad? On her fourth studio album asJapanese Breakfast,For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), Michelle Zauner luxuriates in the aesthetics of the titular emotion. Plush beds of strings recall days spent wallowing between the sheets—presumably silk—while sweeping references to Leda, Icarus, and Venus evoke heartache and yearning of mythological proportions. Inthe self-directed music videofor the romantic lead single, “Orlando in Love,” Zauner dons a hat and tights to play the buccaneering Renaissance poet she sings about. The misty, candlelit vignette is a fitting introduction to a record on which Zauner drapes her sadness around her like a costume.\nThis is not to accuse Zauner of inauthenticity, but rather to say that this record is a winkingly adventurous one. Zauner’s previous albums were each their own form of intimate emotional archaeology: She traced grief and heartache on her lo-fi debut,Psychopomp, and burst with ebullient, synth-dappled joy on her closest thing to a pop record,Jubilee, in 2021. AlongsideJubilee, Zauner also published the hugely successfulCrying in H Mart,a tender and devastating memoir about the death of her mother and her relationship with her Korean heritage. After the latter album and book propelled her to new levels of attention,Zauner describedfeeling as though she were “sitting at a poker table and… just winning hand after hand and [being] so afraid of losing the entire time.” Her intense tour schedule led to health anxiety and stress-induced illnesses, undercutting the public career highs with private lows. It’s perhaps no surprise that, despite being best known for her autobiographical work, on this release she turns her lens outwards, roaming through fictional landscapes and examining the performances and perils of fame itself.\nFor Melancholy Brunettesis Zauner’s fourth full-length release, but also, in a way, her first studio album: While previous albums were recorded in makeshift DIY spaces, this one benefitted from the use of bonafide recording studios and the input of renowned producerBlake Mills(Fiona Apple,Perfume Genius). The difference in Zauner’s sound is palpable, from the very moment the opening ballad “Here Is Someone” glitters to life with spectral strings and segues into the slow march of “Orlando.” Despite its orchestral, Romantic (with a capital R) beginnings, the record quickly turns toward the sepia soundscapes of country music, its melancholia taking shape as metallic guitar twangs and rolling percussion.\nAt just half an hour, this is a slight album, despite moments of heart-bursting ambition that at times leave you wishing for more to sink your teeth into. The spare ballad “Little Girl” trickles past pleasantly like a bubbling stream, as does “Men in Bars,” a plaintive duet withJeff Bridges. The album’s more propulsive moments are its most impressive: “Mega Circuit” is a grunge-y, mud-slinging take on the Andrew Tate-ification of young men with woozy slide guitar and jaunty piano, its sinister shuffle bringing to life the ways in which sadness can metastasize into vitriol and hatred. “Honey Water,” a rollicking rock song told from the embittered perspective of the wife of a serial cheater, glides its way into the most cathartic of psychedelic breakdowns, dazzling in its rage.\nThe scene-stealer is “Picture Window,” a tale of love and its necessary companion, loss. The song’s double-edged hook—“All of my ghosts are real,” Zauner intones cheerfully over a dark, insistent guitar thrum—is one of her most extravagantly melancholic moments. But just on the other side of it, the instrumentation coils tightly, leaving her voice bare and exposed as she sings of the pre-emptive terror of imagining the death of someone you love more than life itself. Even at her most theatrical, Zauner’s songwriting crackles with these electric moments of intimacy, pulling you close enough to see the tears drying in the stage make-up.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Elmoe’s “Whea Yo Ghost At, Whea Yo Dead Man” topped the tracklist of Planet Mu’s iconic 2010 compilationBangs & Works Vol. 1, sneaking in just ahead of the godfatherDJ Rashad’s “Teknitian.” Elmoe’s track wasn’t typical footwork, though. Instead of juggling dozens of finely chopped samples, “Whea Yo Ghost At, Whea Yo Dead Man” opens with broad, epic synths plucked from theVangelistune “Ask the Mountains.” Planet Mu’s compilation is widely credited with introducing footwork to the world beyond Chicago’s South Side; by opening the record with such an ethereal song,Mike Paradinas’ label put the genre’s experimental side front and center.\n“I don’t make my tracks for people to just dance off to, I make tracks that you can listen to forever,” said Elmoe (aka Johnathan Tapp) in aninterviewin 2019. SinceBangs & Works Vol. 1, he’s been quietly self-releasing his chopped-and-screwed style of footwork onBandcamp, deconstructing the genre’s spartan percussion and juxtaposing it with pitched-down, otherworldly samples.Battle Zone, Tapp’s full-length Planet Mu debut, is actually a cherry-picked compilation of his back catalog; the earliest tune on it (“Battle Zone”) was self-released back in February 2014.\nRemarkably, though,Battle Zonefeels less like a compilation that spans over a decade of his music-making career than a labored-over full-length representing a delineated period of time. For the duration of the record,Battle Zoneoperates firmly within its own mutated definition of footwork, exploring a range of fast-paced tempos (instead of sticking to the genre’s standardized 160 BPM) and wielding the Chicago style’s sharp but mithril-light percussion with the sparing touch of an early-’00s dubstep producer and the guile of a free-jazz drummer.\nTapp played percussion in a band before he started producing footwork, which might be why his drums are so pronounced. Rather than crowd his compositions, he gives each hat, snare, and 808 kick the same time, space, and precision you would need to spark fire from a flint. Hollow drums stutter over glowing metallophones on “Come Back”; light-footed 808s dance around Sanny Alves’ warm Portuguese-language vocals on “Yes I Do”; and a closed hat and snare triplet dot the slurred rewind effect on “Bangin Vox” like an ellipsis. Tapp’s clipped percussion jumps out from these smooth, sepia-hued soundstages unbound to any particular structure.\nThis means tracks rarely go in the direction you expect them to. In the dying seconds of “Ina Rain,” its throbbing sub-bass begins swooping up and down as though set free and jumping for joy. The sprightly synths that open “Wander Nights” teeter on the edge of a minor-key transition until a full-bodied accordion blossoms and teleports you straight to the French Riviera. A barrage ofmotherfuckers attack the jubilant parade of piano and strings on “Give It to Em.” And on “Battle Zone,” Tapp abruptly pitches the track’s soaring synth arpeggios and confident “Like it’s hot” vocal down an octave to a more ominous and ambiguous place. These polarizing transitions are bold but not jarring, as though conflicting emotions had been lurking in each track from the get-go."

Born in the peak-bound Kingdom of Bhutan, touted in the West for its Edenic emphasis onGross National Happiness, Dorji left in 2000 to attend a tiny liberal arts college in the ancient mountains of North Carolina. He has mostly remained there, living in a remote Appalachian holler far removed from his adopted country’s crucibles of media or mass protest. What’s more, Dorji is an improvising solo guitarist, wrenching real-time compositions that ride divides between chaos and control, terror and beauty from steel strings that seem to find entirely novel tongues and tones beneath his fingers. Dorji, then, invokes an enduring canard of arts criticism: Can abstract art—and instrumental music, precisely—be political, or say anything explicitly, without so much as a word?\nDorji’s affirmative answer—and the urgent questions his music raises about the ways we live, fight, and die—has never been more emphatic or resolute than onwe will be wherever the fires are lit. Dorji has recorded and released a massive amount of material during the last two decades, a scattershot blast of cassettes, compact discs, collaborations, splits, and LPs divided among more than a dozen labels. But he has the ability to focus his fire, too, to save his clearest and most cohesive work for the biggest megaphone he can muster. In his case, that is Drag City, the Chicago bastion behind his most powerful new works, as well as select reissues from his enormous archive. Arriving amid long-overdue civil-rights reckonings embedded within an international pandemic, 2020’sStateless, his Drag City debut, was a permission slip to reject every inherited American myth. He nodded at the ways one might expect solo guitar music to sound, then split them into pieces—“Statues Crumble, Heroes Fall,” as he aptly put it in the title of its gnarled standout.\nReleased amid another descent into the unknown, its follow-up,we will be wherever the fires are lit, often feels like fight music for battles that may have no end. There is a recognizable violence to many of these songs, with Dorji slashing, bending, pounding, and scraping his strings as if they are a safe sink for terminal anxiety and aggression. Dorji also finds time here to express joy and love, to at least imagine the things we will still covet after the devastation is done, if it ever is. Dorji is an exceptional instrumental technician, his playing bundling a lifetime of heavy metal, post-punk, blues, and noise into five-minute bursts. But more importantly, no other instrumentalist is offering critiques of the United States—or reminders of why they matter—as trenchant and riveting as Dorji, the new friend who walks into your house for the first time and confidently tells you to remodel everything."

    "review_text": "There are four interesting things about rototoms, a specific type of drum that plays an outsized role onYHWH Nailgun’s debut album. They were invented out of necessity in the early 1960s by Al Payson, a concert percussionist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra who needed a quick way to change the pitch of a drum for a new piece he was performing. Two is that Remo Belli, owner and namesake of the famedRemobrand of drums, saw one of Payson’s drums at a drum shop in Chicago and took his invention—a rotating drum with a threaded bolt that pressed on the skin underneath the head of the drum to adjust the pitch—and mass-produced these “rototoms” that look a little like upside down flying saucers upholstered in clear mylar.\nThree is that, in the late 1970s and early ’80s, when Remo rototoms were at their peak, they were often associated with prog rock drummers like Bill Bruford or Terry Bozzio or employed by technical drummers who believe the ideal number of drums to have in your kit is a lot. Rototoms were a strong spice in any band because, four, and most importantly, the sound of a rototom is unmistakable. Because they do not have a resonant shell like a normal concert drum, rototoms are all attack and no boom, a sharp but rubbery pitch that sounds almost like an electronic drum pad living in the uncanny valley just shy of a digital reproduction.\nThis sound is a signature element of the New York noise rock band’s tough, impressive, astonishingly good debut,45 Pounds. The way drummer Sam Pickard uses these rototoms reminds me of whatDaniel Lopatinonce cheekily referred to as “timbral fascism.” It’s the idea that some vintage sounds, like chintzy new age synths, proggy rototoms, or nu-metal seven-string guitars, are forever doomed to connote some historically uncool context. What YHWH Nailgun—pronounced “Yahweh” as in the name of God in the Hebrew Bible—does so exceptionally well in just 21 minutes is recontextualize not just the rototoms, but a world of experimental and avant-garde music into a sleek, four-person machine that operates with almost zero entropy. This is a band so instinctive and expressive that its greatness lies not just in what’s happening on the record, but in what could possibly happen next.\nAfter forming in Philadelphia during the pandemic, Pickard and vocalist Zack Borzone—who sings with the tone and urgency of someone being strangled—brought the group to NYC, added Saguiv Rosenstock on guitar and Jack Tobias on electronics, and drew up the schematics for a couple of EPs that introduced the band’s live-wire energy. For their debut, they signed to the London imprint AD 93, a key to locating and defining the sound of YHWH Nailgun in contemporary music. For many years, AD 93 (fka Whities) signed electronic acts, but more recently their roster has filled with idiosyncratic and hypnotic bands redrawing the boundaries of experimental rock. There is a string that begins with the slack, patient style ofStill House Plants, pulled tighter by the avant-electronic grooves ofMoin, and finally torqued to its maximum tension by YHWH Nailgun."

    "review_text": "Seventeen was a very good year: sneaking out to dance all night atHugs&Kisses, swigging peach schnapps from a jewel-encrusted flask at theMercat Basement, being the first to arrive and the first to leave atMisty Nights. I lived in a relatively small city but I didn’t know anyone, or anything, so the nights felt rich and intoxicating, and ever so slightly dangerous. The first time you go out, your tiny internal world suddenly feels massive.\nBig city life, the fabulous and melancholy new album bySmerz, distils this feeling into a potent moonshine. It’s romantic and itchily excitable music—a mixtape for the long train ride into the city and the delirious cab home, to hum at your retail job while you’re waiting to clock off—and it strikes, immediately, as Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt’s gesamtkunstwerk, a record that synthesizes the fright-night beats of 2018’sHave funwith the contemporary classical experiments ofBelieverandFør og etterand the arch electroclash of last year’sAllina.\nOnBig city life, all those paths twist together, creating dazzling formations: lush trip-hop torch songs, swaggering electro grooves, dance tracks that sound likeLiquid Liquidblasting into an empty club after the lights come on. All this takes place in a romantasy version of Oslo where the streets are always rain-slicked and the clubs always smell like rareBaccarat Rouge 540—the perfect setting for modern fables about growing up, going out, and falling in love.\nLike any good fairytale,Big city lifebegins with Smerz’s version ofan “I Want” song. The title track will strike as familiar to anyone who’s woken up one day and realized they’re running on autopilot: “I heard the trip was great ha ha ha,” Motzfeld sings lifelessly. Day-to-day social niceties are anathema to Smerz; the only cure is “the freedom of a big city,” a wild, unscripted world where you’re not just repeating “I heard that they broke up ha ha ha” over and over at the social function.\nStoltenberg and Motzfeldt’s vocals frequently scan as droll, in the vein of other irony-drenched deadpan-pop duos likeCoco & Clair ClairorNew York, but there is a difference between Motzfeldt's anhedonia on the title track and, say, the sly encouragement with which Stoltenberg raps on “Roll the dice.” It’s their take on “Dancing Queen,” written entirely in the second person in hopes of reaching the high-potential wallflower who needs it most: “When you’re here, all dressed up, looking ready and nice/Feel the places, walk the streets, and take no advice.” This is Smerz’s best party trick onBig city life: making music that reminds you of the club but is by no means club music. “Roll the dice”s is built around a slinky piano riff and what sounds like a chopped-up techno break, but moves with the affected looseness of Parker Poseydancing among the stacksinParty Girl. This is the zone ofBig city life: the space between aspiration and reality."

To name two: flansie and Skimayne’s synth storm onYeat’s “Gët Busy” and OK’s bruising bassline onOsamaSon’s “Fool.” For a couple years in the late 2010s, Pi’erre was one of the most innovative producers in hip-hop, concocting pure ear candy by layering sugary electronic melodies and silly soundbites over locomotive 808s. You can hear plenty of Atlanta in his beats, but albums likeThe Life of Pi’erre 4sound more like he’s hotboxing a spaceship in the vein ofWiz Khalifa, Sledgren, andCardo Got Wings.\nThe next star in the lineage of futuristic chill might be Minneapolis producertdf. A fixture of 2020s blown-out underground rap, he’s surely studied Pi’erre’s music like a sacred text. His great new album,CULTURE, is full of similarly dramatic transitions, collagist sound design and hypnotic melodies that seem suspended in time. But tdf transcends Pi’erre’s sound by leaning into the swampiness, cranking up the low end, and scuffing up the mixes a bit more. He also leans harder into the ethos of a mixtape, playing conductor to a chorus of underground rappers. These songs were likely stitched together over email or Discord and assembled piecemeal, but they have the lived-in feel of a stoned hangout in the basement.\nEven with all the vocalists in the mix, the star of the show here is tdf, who fits together drums, melodies and samples into chugging, noisy dreamscapes. A flip of aFrank OceanTumblr classicbecomes the gleefully twitchy “Numb” with jssr. On the next song, “Stamped,” tdf cuts up on a keyboard as 1oneam deadpans sweet nothings. Like the artists he’s influenced by, it’s hard not to mention “vibes” when talking about this music—zone out and let this tape’s hazy synth clouds wash over you. Key to his beat construction are bits of found sound, which are sometimes so sticky and surprising they’re like mini hooks. Like Pi’erre Bourne, he loves animal sounds, lion roars especially, but he can get even weirder; on “Still My Patna” with ATL Smook, he punctuates bars with a sample ofDragonball Zcharacter Goku screaming.\nCULTUREcould use even more of this cheekiness. I miss the irreverence of his 2023 albumBLUEPRINT, where he spams actual audio snippets of salty haters saying things like, “N***a put somebody namedSpoofon his tape; that is the craziest shit I ever seen, bro.” (Justice for Spoof; he slid on “Bands Gone!”)CULTUREhas narration, too, but this time it’s from an aggravating uncle who sounds like he was given zero guidance on what to talk about."

    "review_text": "In an alternate universe,Nazar’s 2020 debut albumGuerillacould have been one of the electronic music success stories of the decade. Alas, it was released on March 13, two days after the World Health Organization proclaimed COVID-19 a global pandemic and lockdowns cascaded around the world. This was not a great time for dance music, even dance music as unusual asGuerilla, which was inspired by Nazar’s father’s role in the Angolan Civil War and laced with iPhone recordings made on road trips across the Southern African country.Guerillawas what Nazar called “rough kuduro,” taking the unsteady gait of Angola’s greatest musical export and spiking it with adrenaline, sweat, fear, and the nocturnal unease of fellow Hyperdub producerBurial. Then he all but disappeared.\nNazar has a remarkable backstory. His father was a general and diplomat for theUNITArebels (and now second biggest political party) who fought, assisted by the U.S., against the rulingMPLA. Guerillawas based on Nazar’s father’s memoirs, its album cover taken from a film circulated by the MPLA to humiliate UNITA. The war drove Nazar and his mother into exile in Belgium, where Nazar worked to piece his father’s life together from afar before returning to Luanda, a personal journey that culminated inGuerilla. Making that album, and criss-crossing the war-torn country, was a physical and spiritual ordeal. Nazar contracted tuberculosis, which flared up after a bout with COVID, upending and almost taking his life. IfGuerillawas a document of a civil war, its follow-up,Demilitarize, is the record of Nazar’s own internal struggle after making it.\nInstead of the rugged landscape of Angola,Demilitarizesurveys Nazar’s mind. It’s brighter and more spacious thanGuerilla, an inversion of that album’s olive camo-toned world. Here, the kuduro is a little less rough, almost woozy, more like Nazar’s version of a bedroom pop record: close, whispery, introspective. The music comes in fits and starts, like listening to a half-conscious sleepyhead try to recall their dreams—it’s easy to imagine Nazar, stricken for an entire year by disease, stuck in bed and coming up with new rhythms in his head. “I let my drums pass the message,” he mutters on “Mantra,” as if the extent of his communication is now limited to music.\nNazar’s central presence is the most striking change onDemilitarize. His own voice is everywhere—singing, mumbling, and talking to himself, telling a story or stuck looping in a fever dream. He sounds like a warblyJames Blakeon opener “Anticipate,” wheezy and almost off-putting, uncomfortable footing steadied by the organ-led R&B lilt of “Core.” The rhythms onDemilitarizeare by turns irregular and majestic, made all the more stunning by their rawness: The ticking trap hi-hats on “Unlearn” feel like they were haphazardly soldered to keep the whole thing together, lending a kind of raw, DIY beauty. The colors are bright and the synths are like a cool breeze—but it’s the kind of cold that can suddenly turn bitter, as on “Heal,” a mood-swingy track about being stuck in bed that compresses a mental-health episode into five riveting minutes."

    "review_text": "Do you want to throw your phone into a blender? Do you want to squeeze out five full seconds of your own attention without the heat of a blinking cursor, a twitching ad, an ambient anxiety underscoring every sentence? You can yearn for the apocalypse, or, maybe more pointedly, for the year 2010.Sleigh Bellsare there with you, spiraling and scrolling. Consciousness might be abit muchright now, the band says. They’re grasping for a pause button.\nSleigh Bells got so much right. They mashed together frenetic beats and airy synths and hulking drums; they were loud and dense and frenetic, tightly controlled but impossible to predict. The more albums they made, the more they strayed from what worked.Bitter Rivalssmashed through the soundboard, like the band had turned every dial up to its loudest setting and hoped the noise would be enough.Jessica Rabbitslipped between genres instead of breaking them apart, sometimes filtering the chaos into cookie-cutter electro-pop.Texis, the band’s 2021 release, could sound like diluted versions of early demos. It should be a relief thatBunky Becky Birthday Boy, their latest album, presents itself as something new. But the record doesn’t shape-shift as much as it leans into some of their most abrasive instincts.\nBunky Becky is a nickname for singer Alexis Krauss’ late dog, Riz. “We wanted the track to sound like a dog having the best moment of her life without any of the burden of self consciousness,” Derek Miller, the guitarist and producer of the group, wrote of thelead singlein a press release—a cute concept that veers intoMickey Mouse Clubhouseterritory as the duo chants “Bunky Becky Birthday Girl!” Sleigh Bells’ songs have rarely rewarded close attention to the lyrics—their best music is physical enough to distract from the occasional clunker—but these songs are tepid enough to leave you fixated on phrases like, “I tell you, ‘I love you’/’Cause you’re a cool one forever” and “The moment is real, the moment is magic.” The chief offender is “Life Was Real,” which applies the choppy Sleigh Bells dynamic to “Sk8er Boi”-style guitars. “Life was real and dark and crazy,” Krauss sings, before sneering, “Arrest me, sad face!”\nThe emoji might’ve worked with more weirdness surrounding it.Bunky Becky Birthday Boyis clean and crisp where it should spin out, bubbly where it should be brash. The inventiveness that animatedTreatsshows up only in a handful of moments in the back half: the 15 seconds of quasi-rap that make “Blasted Shadow” catchy instead of merely tolerable, or the first 30 seconds of “Badly,” which sound like100 gecs—a band clearly indebted to Sleigh Bells, and currently outdoing Sleigh Bells at their own schtick. Even tracks that circle around a hazily imagined apocalypse—“This summer might be your last!”—can’t summon more than half a head bob. There’s enough energy pumping through these songs to move the 32-minute album along, but it feels like you’re slouching through the moving walkway at an airport."

    "review_text": "“I want it now, never, always,” Tashiina Buswa sings on “Look What You Did,” the penultimate track onRibbon Skirt’s debut album,Bite Down. It’s a decent summation of her storytelling style: Everything is simultaneously happening, has already happened, hasn’t happened yet, and will never happen. Each memory is in constant danger of getting smothered in distortion, trampled by drums, or even warped by Auto-Tune into a funhouse-mirror reflection of itself—so you’d better listen carefully.\nFormerly known asLove Language, Ribbon Skirt are the Montreal-based duo of singer and guitarist Tashiina Buswa and multi-instrumentalist Billy Riley; they’re named after a traditional Native American and First Nations garment symbolizing resilience and femininity—a nod to Buswa’s Anishinaabe heritage.Bite Downis many things: a reevaluation of Buswa and Riley’s musical inclinations, a first-person account of inherited colonial trauma, and a refreshing take on some of contemporary indie rock’s most overused influences (shoegaze, grunge, post-punk that leans so far into the second word that you might as well do away with the first). Co-produced by Scott “Monty” Munro (ofPreoccupations) and Marlaena Moore, and mixed byDeerhoof’s Greg Saunier, the record has a grainy, tactile feel reminiscent ofLive Through This. Its room tone is as pronounced as any individual instrument; inBite Down’s most emotionally dense moments, you can hear the heat moving between wood and wire.\nRibbon Skirt call to mind the more roughed-up offerings fromMichelleZauner(or the prettier ones fromMannequin Pussy), but more than anyone else, Buswa’s modern gothic vignettes and ragged yet pliable vocals recallWednesday’s Karly Hartzman. Buswa isn’t one to shy away from morbidity, irreverence, or the occasional primal howl—because some things are better expressed with no words at all.Bite Downembodies the claustrophobia of a present cluttered by the past, of a life interrupted by the stories that’ll be told about it. Mundanity and tragedy spill from Buswa’s pen with equal urgency. The pile of incident reports grows high with dead uncles, cop cars, White Jesus, nightmares about drowning, and piss in cups.\nOn the jangly ballad “Off-Rez,” Buswa rejects whitewashed, tokenizing narratives of Indigeneity, her delivery landing somewhere between ’90s slacker deadpan and Valley Girl uptalk (“They want 2000s Buffy Marie…They want the pipe and the drum”). As the tactics of colonialism shapeshift, so does Buswa’s grief. “Off-Rez” takes aim at the subtly insidious ways that anti-Indigenous racism persists. “I’m gonna break into a dance down the hall/I’m gonna be your brand new headache to solve,” she declares, tossing sand into the gears of bureaucratic systems that “make these Indians run.” An Anishinaabe person living in a major Canadian city, Buswa grapples with a loss of cultural identity on multiple levels. “I wanna preserve every part that makes me” she sings, “Not only know but really feel that I’m free.”"

    "review_text": "Damon McMahon made the dead speak. He had been conversing with them for some time. “I got turned on to a lot of teachers, all of whom are dead,” hesays. He learned from legendary French music teacher Nadia Boulanger, comedians Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, and the great hip-hop producerJ Dilla. McMahon recruited them all for this year’s excellentAmen Dunesfull-lengthDeath Jokes, a protest album that took aim at the music industry’s subservience to the algorithm, the digital grid, and the bottom line. Samples of their voices and many others crowd the record with urgent messages from beyond the grave: warnings about censorship, greed, and exploitation. The problem is that no one would heed them once McMahon was finished with his album.\nThe making ofDeath Jokeswas a struggle. It took three years, 21 failed collaborations, and three separate mixes before McMahon arrived at a version that satisfied him. McMahon took piano lessons from a psychic medium named Jonichi, a student of Boulanger’s. He taught himself to use Ableton Live and a broken Roland TR-909 drum machine. The idea was to shake himself out of his routine and make music like an amateur again, but he was met with blank stares and furrowed brows from engineers, producers, and studio musicians. McMahon felt that the response from fans and critics was similarly uncomprehending.Death Jokeswas a purposefully difficult record, but nobody seemed to take it on its own terms. His frustration mounted in a series of interviews. “It was disappointing. You know, the world often doesn't want to be challenged. That feels very sad to me,” he explained. He began to speculate openly about quitting music altogether.\nDeath Jokes IIcomes as a surprise, then, but the accompanying announcement that Amen Dunes is coming to an end is perhaps less unexpected. The critical success of 2018’sFreedomlaunched McMahon into the upper echelon of the indie music world. A lukewarm reception for the follow-up to such a success is not unusual, and Amen Dunes’ move to the vaunted Sub Pop label surely bought him a grace period in which to experiment. But McMahon isn’t concerned with maintaining his place in an industry that he increasingly sees as irredeemable. “Goodbye, I've barely said a word to you, but it's always like that at parties,” McMahon said. “Let's hope that when we are dead things will be better arranged.”\nHis farewell note amounts to its own kind of death joke. Whether through a sudden moment of clarity or a dejected concession to popular taste,Death Jokes IIis indeed better arranged than its predecessor. McMahon went back to a failed 2021 session to recover discarded parts by keyboardistMoney Mark, drummers Jim Keltner and Carla Azar, and several otherDeath Jokescontributors. He then collaborated with mixer Craig Silvey, one of a few kindred spirits who understood the album, on a pared-down interpretation of its songs. These are less remixes than alternate versions, with the spirit of the originals intact, even amplified. The hip-hop-inspired intros, outros, and interludes are gone, as are the overwhelming collages. The compositions themselves are leaner, with more focus on McMahon’s inimitable slurred vibrato. Now, it is only his voice that is speaking to us, directly and intimately, from behind the veil of Amen Dunes’ demise."

    "review_text": "It starts with a bang. Then a barrage of DJ tags, sampled vocals, and drum rolls carry us into a sea of ambience. This is theLos Thuthanakaexperience in summary: ceremonial but swaggy, cataclysmic but healing, unrefined but magnificent. And these are the paradoxes you are confronted with immediately upon hitting play: A dizzying reorientation to the possibility of what music can or should sound like. The monumental self-titled debut from siblingsChuquimamani-CondoriandJoshua Chuquimia Cramptontaps into the elemental practices of making music. The latterhas describedtheir work as striving to bring out “as much as possible from seemingly very little.” The “seemingly” is key, as in his hands, every note is an infinite portal.\nThe blistering, collagic dance songs ofLos Thuthanakaare all about negotiating with time, collapsing it so that it no longer feels linear. “For us Aymara,” Chuquimamani-Condorihas saidof their Indigenous heritage rooted in the Andes mountains of South America, “the future does not lie ahead but is behind us… to move forward is to also return.” This is a tremendously difficult idea to capture in song, but “Ipi Saxra” (“Dumb Evil”) comes close. Its evolution is incremental but continuously jolting, mostly due to Crampton’s electric guitar riffs flourishing and decaying alongside Chuquimamani-Condori’s dual-keytar rig. By the final two minutes, the track becomes a site of rapturous noise and booming percussion, but it doesn’t seem like much has changed at all—were we always here?\nThere’s something to these subtle developments and the way they seem inevitable, like the songs are embodying theprophetic perfect tense. Ten years ago, when Chuquimamani-Condori (asElysia Crampton) tossedLil Jonad-libsover traditional rhythms, the juxtaposition felt like a way of interrogating established aesthetics. “Ipi Saxra” boasts a similarly bizarre arrangement, but its shuffling groove, synth stabs, and vocal samples are a reimagination of the recognizable. Its second-long grunts sound like someone hammering buttons on an arcade fighter, hoping to execute the perfect combo. But the repetition also feels incantational, like the musicians are conjuring new paths for the song to go down.\nLos Thuthanakais a noisy, anticolonialist piece of music, and the former descriptor relates to the latter. In various interviews, Chuquimamani-Condorihas decriedso-called colonial norms, like how people are taught to “divide the universe into discrete objects, taxonomies, and hierarchies of relationality.” Two years ago, they and their brother held anexhibition at MoMA PS1that sought instead to convey a philosophy of interconnectedness. Visitors seated in beanbag chairs could put on headphones and hear stories from the siblings’ ancestors, all while speakers blasted their futuristic music. Hearing both audio tracks at the same time made obvious how imagining a new world is inseparable from its communal past."

He spoke about wanting to make music to “provoke beauty and emotion” and said that his next album would mark the end of his relationship with Atlantic. Half a year later, that album finally lands—initially as a Dropbox link emailed to fans after an invite-only listening party in Miami, and then on all the usual streaming platforms. A bracing return to his dubstep roots, the album represents a hard left turn from the prismatic crossover pop and hip-hop of 2023’s double-albumQuest for Fire / Don’t Get Too Close; the main emotion thatFUCK U SKRILLEX YOU THINK UR ANDY WARHOL BUT UR NOT!! <3provokes is someone screaming “LET’S FUCKING GOOOO” after a few too many shots.\nThe title sounds like a pisstake—but the record is a flex. Coming right after Skrillex’s triumphant return to Ultra Music Festival, the album crash-lands back into the crowded post-EDM scene he helped create, bouncing between dubstep, drum’n’bass, trap, and UK garage with a scattershot focus that no amount of Adderall could sharpen. With 34 tracks packed into 46 minutes, the chaotic pace and relentless gags make it sound tossed off. But it’s the first full-length that captures the true range of his music.

    "review_text": "IfRosco P. Coldchainwas rap’sMoonlight Graham—a perennial, on-the-cusp prospect, his breakthrough deferred by a 14-year prison stint—his cult status is, in its way, untarnished. The Philadelphia native is more could’ve-been than never-was, firmly canonized for his supporting roles onLord Willin’andClones. A precise, kinetic technician, he found a home amidthe Neptunes’ turn-of-the-century production, weaving around their syncopated drums and space-age synths. His shelved debut,Hazardous Life, a casualty of the 2004 Arista merger, promised to wedClipse’s acrobatics with northeastern pugilism.\nWhat music actually saw light is another story. After parting ways withPharrellandChad Hugo, Coldchain hit the studio with North Carolina producer Fatin Horton, an understudy of9th Wonder. The output of those sessions—collected on 2012’s aptly titledAlmost Famous, released some half-decade into Coldchain’s sentence—is irresolute post-backpack rap, a rejection of the Neptunes’ million-dollar sheen. Coldchain is animated as ever, but the swing is gone, the fireworks dimmed. In either case, the squeaky-clean music acted as a counterweight, isolating Coldchain’s vocal depths and rhythmic idiosyncrasies. If it never cohered stylistically, it made sense logistically.\nColdchain returned to the booth upon his release in early 2023;For the Maturefollows on the heels of 2024’sLiving on Borrowed Time. The new album, produced by Philadelphia neighbor Keem Kong, positions Coldchain as an honorable elder statesman with a Swiss Army knife skillset. Opener “Caught Up” plays like an off-the-cuff manifesto, rhymes nested in knotty clusters and delivered with conversational breeziness. Coldchain’s couplets assume downhill momentum on “High Horse,” the slanted single-time flow giving way to an emphatic double-time cadence. Guest rapper Ant White is left holding the bag on the song’s second verse, spinning his wheels in search of verbiage and mechanics to match.\nYou want to focus on Coldchain’s bars and syllabic patterns, butFor the Matureis devoted to concept records of middling distinction: an award ceremony, a lockup diary, a Kim-and-Kanye parable. The prison monologue “Visits” is an exacting play-by-play, from fingerprinting at intake to delirious prescription-drug withdrawals. But Coldchain is hemmed in—literally—by the setup, able to take the device in only so many directions. The album’s midtempo production otherwise guarantees room for Coldchain’s maneuvers, Kong favoring chilly rimshots and single-tracked keyboards. Had he followed that thread, he might’ve arrived at a blues-club intimacy; as is, the ambiance is hedged and clinical.\nTo his credit, Coldchain’s never been bound to a single sound, or attempted to replicate past glories. What he’s lacked, through shifting phases, is a stable of producers and collaborators to reflect—rather than contrast—his ornate grit. He and Kong might have taken cues from Dark Lo, a Philadelphia rapper of similar sensibility, whose incarceration interrupted a string of riveting, bellowing street operas. Instead, Coldchain spendsFor the Maturein a state of adaptation, prowling the outskirts for a new niche or a lost path."

    "review_text": "This past Christmas, a girl you knew in high school recused herself from the family dinner table, shut herself in her teenage bedroom and, illuminated by the light of her sunset lamp, sent 13 back-to-back texts that all turned green. All the while, she screamed along to her new mantra: “My turn, mine to do the hurtin’/Your turn to bear the burdеn/My turn, ’cause I deservе this.”\nIt was an early gift fromSZA(which still managed to arrivea little late): 15 diaphanous new songs that are beautiful but frequently as antagonistic as fiberglass dust, peaking with “My Turn,” a revenge anthem less violent than 2022’s inescapable murder fantasy “Kill Bill” but no less twisted. These songs are packaged with that year’s mega-sellingSOSunder the titleSOS Deluxe: Lana, but they function better on their own: Unlike the rambunctious, mixtape-y genre hopping of its predecessor,Lanais aesthetically coherent, filled with warm analog synths and soul-ballad tempos. There are fewer piquant quotables, but it feels less jittery thanSOS, closer in tone to the SZA of 2017’sCTRL, who laid bare her fears and flaws with the casual affect of a model doing a “What’s in My Bag” video. Put these songs in their own playlist and you can proudly callLanathe third SZA album—one worthy of its predecessors.\n“My Turn” does a good deal of explaining why SZA, a bolder and weirder star than is usually embraced by the pop firmament, ended up with her name attached toSOS, one of the most successful R&B records of all time. Aside from, perhaps,Charli XCX, SZA is the only pop star who truly meets Our Moment on its own terms: She takes the emotional landscape of TikTok—a world where therapy terms are abused, no one can agree which flags are red, and everyone is “crashing out,” a favorite SZAism—and wraps it up in her own kind of pop classicism, a stew that onLanacontains elements of Latin jazz, new age, psych-rock, soul, and ’90s R&B, among many other things. This (on-paper) clash of form and function means that SZA’s music feels both electrifyingly current and built to last—a balance many of her chart peers have struggled to strike.\nBut next to every song that asserts some kind of self-love through an act of emotional terrorism, SZA leaves an asterisk: She is incapable of sweeping her own culpability under the rug. UnlikeAriana Grande, whose latest albumeternal sunshinewas filled with ersatz therapy platitudes (and conspicuously free of genuine conflict), SZA lays bare the ways in which the idea of “looking out for number one” can become a cope for toxic behavior. “My Turn” is explicit in its desire to inflict pain; “Crybaby,” a gorgeous, sunkissed ballad where SZA bemoans her inability to stop “blaming the world for my faults,” ends with the dryly hilarious refrain, “I know you told stories about me/Most of them awful, all of them true.” Many stars brandish “authenticity” hoping their fans will be too besotted to see it as another kind of costume; SZA pays for hers song by song, never condescending to her audience."

On “Bandorai,” Trappes mourns the loss of the past while navigating the tumult of her present, an uncomfortable push-and-pull that defines her gothy fifth album, which combines drone, modern classical, and neofolk.\nMost of Trappes’ solo music falls under the ambient umbrella. Hertrilogyof self-titled records exploded dream pop into something cold and occluded—music that billowed outwards instead of inviting you into its seductive embrace.A Requiemis different, less dissolute. Here, the songs snap back into (soft) focus on an album that interrogates Trappes’ own cross-generational trauma and family strife. It’s a lot for 34 minutes, but she comes out the other side renewed, having passed through a period of intense introspection and psychedelic therapy.\nTo recordA Requiem,the Australian-born, Brighton-based musician traveled to Glasgow, where she connected with her Celtic ancestry in a way she never had before. She has said that the music is rooted in the British Isles, though those links are not always apparent—some tracks are devoid of words, in favor of primordial keens and wails, while others draw out words like “ocean” or “home.” With its deep exhales and arch vocals,A Requiemreminds me most of late periodCoil, when the UK group decamped from London to the Somerset countryside and mademusicto soundtrack nightly walks in the pitch-black forest. Trappes’ compositions are just as environmental, descending like a shroud of mist.\nTrappes works out her demons in real time, alternating between brighter passages like “Anchor Us to Second Floor” and heavier centerpieces like “Sleep,” which moves with the halting clank of some eldritch monstrosity. She commands a choir of ghosts with a quiet-loud dynamic worthy ofScott Walker’s 1995 masterpieceTilt.The other highlight, “Red Dove,” reminds me ofJames Holden’sThe Inheritors, built around an arpeggiated synth that sounds more medieval than modern, underlining the song’s grotesque chorus: “Wash it down/With violent hope.”\nThe album lurches toward resolution in the stunning “Torc,” where the sound design comes to a head. A crackling noise resembles rain, but as it grows more intense, it could be a funeral pyre, burning what came before and letting loose a cleansing, perfumed smoke. “Torc” turns the album’s leaden drones into a synth-string overture worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster before the album closes on aSigur Rós-ian note with the gorgeous “Thou Art Mortal,” sung in Gaelic rather than Hopelandic."

That “early” is an important distinction: The album stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from the goth titans’ monumentalSongs of a Lost World.Most songs here clock in at three minutes or under, and the music is tender and raw, born out of improvised instrumental sessions to which the band’s four members, Levi, Raisa Khan, Marc Pell (aka Suitman Jungle), and CJ Calderwood, added vocals. This is no slight against epic dream pop—which Levi also tackled on the sprawling 2024 single “slob air”—but it is invigorating to hear someone so elegantly explore the path less travelled.\nAll Kinds of Daysmay be far removed from the grand artistic strokes of much modern guitar music, but it is ambitious in its own quietly unassuming way. The band explores weighty topics—motherhood (“Mirror Mirror”), loss (“After.Spirit”), and change (“Turbine”)—while throwing angular saxophone, discombobulated vocal loops, and shifting electronic textures into an ingenious and ever-changing mix.\nThis is a record that emphaticallydoesrather thansays, its experimentation nestled snugly at the core of the songs. “After.Spirit” complements a spindly guitar riff with a nebulous layer of electronics and woodwind textures that falls like the lingering shadow of shoegaze. “Shaded Tree” isRadioheadbeing assaulted by aJohn Zornsaxophone freakout; and “Twist the Handle” uses a dinky synth riff and Calderwood’s submerged vocal loops to create a treacherous soundscape for Pell’s bizarrely chirpy to-do list.\nThe band takes a similarly understated approach behind the mic. OnShades, Good Sad Happy Bad’s previous album, Khan moved from keyboard to lead vocals. But the situation onAll Kinds of Daysis more fluid. Khan takes the lead on several of the album’s strongest songs, including “Frontline,” whose melody suggests the disturbingly detached beauty of aSyd Barrettsolo record, and “Guiding Light,” where she delivers the nursery rhyme of your unsettled dreams, simultaneously fragile and offsetting. Elsewhere, Calderwood’s vocal loops provide the spectral topping for the garage-rock chug of “Lonely Well,” while Levi’s slouchy angel mumble, likeMudhoneyon Mogadon, is perfect for the grunge-y droop of “Irresistible.”"

    "review_text": "OnLucy Dacus’ fourth album, she threatens to throw a fit if she can’t win her girl’s heart. She swears that if she doesn’t, she’ll lose her mind. She wants to feel her crush’s canines pierce her shoulder, have her hair yanked, be dragged feet-first into bed to give herself over fully. She feels alive when she’s behaving her worst. She wants to scream her beau’s name on the street until her throat is raw and infants recoil in terror. So why doesn’t she?\nForever Is a Feelingis, per a recentNew Yorkerprofile, the Virginia songwriter’s account of coming to terms with her feelings for herBoygeniusbandmateJulien Baker, from unsuccessful denial to ecstatic realization, and ending another relationship along the way. There are thighs grabbed under restaurant tables, a sensual bliss that is both tempered and enhanced by her mature perspective: “Nothing lasts forever but let’s see how far we get/So when it comes my turn to lose you I’ll have made the most of it,” as Dacus sings on “Lost Time.” It’s typical of the 29-year-old musician’s appealingly earnest wisdom, of lessons learned the hard way—yet the music here feels hamstrung by caution and daintiness, protecting infatuation in its gilded cage.\nTake lead single “Ankles,” a fantasy about forbidden sex and overcoming shame: “How lucky are we to have so much to lose,” Dacus sings. But the song itself is courtly, the mildly suggestive groove and gasped intonation of the first verse giving way to a sparkly reverie that sounds made to soundtrack a queer-coded Netflix adaptation of a Regency novel. Her daydream concludes with thoughts of tea in the morning: “Ask me how did I…sleep,” Dacus sings, savoring a cutesy pause like the first sip. It’s briskly demure, lacking lust or carnality or even the guilty stomach flip of a properly obsessive crush you shouldn’t be entertaining; the title is apt insofar as it might scandalize a Victorian gentleman.\nMarking her move from Matador to a major label,Forever Is a Feelingis Dacus’ sweetest and most sentimental-sounding album, all but extinguishing the bonfire crackle of her previous records. Love, naturally, is the fuzziest feeling, and even long-term singletons and serial monogamists aren’t immune to the charms of truly moon-eyed music: Listening should feel like having a surrogate crush. But the passion and obsession of Dacus’ lyrics are rarely mirrored in these benign mid-tempo devotionals. There are hot’n’heavy songs set under the covers, “legs all double-knotted in the morning at the Ritz,” but the saccharine instrumentation is more like a wet blanket. “Best Guess” is about putting all your money on red, gambling your future on changing bodies, changing minds. Its limpid guitar and keys shrug along pleasantly, making the song damn with faint praise. If I were someone’s best guess, I’d want more."

    "review_text": "The dream had burned down and a hallucination was stirring in the ashes. America faced its bicentennial through a fog of paranoia, disillusioned and fearful.The president was a crook,the War had been for nothing, and, if you seemed anxious about any of it,the doctor would get you hooked on Valium. It was time to look elsewhere. “We live in a strange time,” the mystic philosopher David Spangler wrote inRevelation: The Birth of a New Age.“A new consciousness of reality, a new image of humanity and of the universe is taking shape in our midst.” We were entering a New Age.\nNobody could have expected the debut album from William Ackerman, a 26-year-old Palo Alto carpenter, to have a hand in ushering in this new consciousness.In Search of the Turtle’s Navelhad been recorded on a whim and pressed in a limited run. It was an impressionistic, instrumental folk record, inspired by the fingerstyle guitaristsJohn FaheyandRobbie Basho, and the turn-of-the-century French minimalist composer Erik Satie. He had ordered three hundred copies from the pressing plant because that was their minimum order, and he quite reasonably expected to have two-thirds of them in his closet forever.\nInstead,In Search of the Turtle’s Navellit the long fuse of the new age music explosion and cleared a path for Ackerman’s own wildly successful record label, Windham Hill. Over the next decade, Windham Hill would grow so large that it would effectively become its own genre, with a sprawling roster of artists and an air of invincibility reinforced by millions of dollars in sales every year.\nIts gently evocative and wordless albums, technically perfect and always engineered in high fidelity,had their own sectionat some Tower Records locations. The label spent a fraction of what the majors did on advertising, because their albums basically sold themselves. George Winston’sAutumn,released in 1980, did for Windham Hill whatKeith Jarrett’sKöln Concerthad done for the German jazz label ECM five years before, selling millions of copies and spawning an army of devotees who sought out the label instead of individual artists. To its myriad critics, it was “yuppie Muzak,” artless and passionless and formless, “the perfect music for washing one’s BMW,” crowed a piece inTime Magazine.But that didn’t slow sales.\nWith his blue jeans, thick cotton shirts, and unkempt ash-blond hair, Ackerman looked less like a businessman and more like the cool youth minister at your local Unitarian church—an image enhanced by the acoustic guitar that accompanied him in most press shots. He had grown up on the outskirts of the Age of Aquarius, adopted as a baby by a professor at Stanford who lived next to campus. As a kid, he fell in love with the enormous folk-revival band the Kingston Trio, who practiced nearby and let him hang out in their rehearsal space. His babysitter was a beatnik who smuggled him into bohemian cafes to absorb the zeitgeist, and a next-door neighbor taught him the basics of the guitar—enough to play rhythm in a covers band."

    "review_text": "Ty Segallmight have been getting ahead of himself last year when hetold an interviewerhe was trying to slow down. “I love being prolific, but sometimes it lessens the whole thing, I feel like, which isn’t what I would like,” he said. “So, I’m actually trying to not release as much anymore.”Right. Shortly thereafter, the ever-industrious garage rocker gave usLove Rudiments, an LP consisting entirely of percussion instrumentals. It was a logical endpoint for the phase of hermetic experimentation that Segall entered circa 2018, in which each new record tackled a different aesthetic: the unrecognizably deep-fried covers ofFudge Sandwich, the synth-pop dreamscapes ofHarmonizer, the basement-dwelling prog-punk ofThree Bells.\nNow approaching 40, Segall shows no signs of slowing down. But his new album,Possession, suggests that the exploratory period might be coming to a close, at least for now. This is a bit of a back-to-basics record for him, which is to say that it falls somewhere in the matrix of glam-inflected psychedelia that broadly defines his catalogue fromGoodbye Breadto the magisterial double LPFreedom’s Goblin. Compared to his earlier albums, though,Possessiontrends toward a warmer, more openly nostalgic brand of stadium rock, packed with power-pop jams and feel-good anthems.\nMuch of the levity comes from the broader palette at Segall’s disposal. There’s an almostSteely Dan-ish buoyancy to the horns that blast on many choruses, and a string quartet lends a breezy dignity to a good portion of the songs. On “Possession,” Segall takes what initially sounds like an electro-convulsed “Ziggy Stardust” and slowly refashions it into a brass-driven epic worthy of David Clayton-Thomas eraBlood, Sweat & Tears, which might be as far as he has gotten from the stripped-down thrasher rock of his youth. As if to retrace that evolution in real time, “Shoplifter,” a song about a destitute kleptomaniac, begins as a sparse garage dirge and gradually accretes instrumental layers until it climaxes with two saxophones chasing each other’s tails as violins climb into the ether.\nSegall co-wrote most ofPossession’s lyrics with Matt Yoka, who has directed the bulk of the rocker’s music videos, including theonein which Segall sits motionless at the center of an increasingly rowdy kegger, attempting to sing the plaintive “Goodbye Bread” as half-naked revelers flail and bump into him. The record is populated by similarly poker-faced loners trying to shrug off the absurdity of a world in slow decline. “Smoke in the summer/The metallic taste like rubber,” Segall sings over an ominous, burbling synth line on “Hotel”: “Traffic in the ocean/Help me with the lotion.”"

It was not as racy or trolling as theBritney-Madonna-Christinakiss. It lacked the intrigue of theCarter-Knowleselevator fight footage. Really, the situation was incredibly straightforward. Chris Rock told a wack joke about Jada Pinkett-Smith, Will overreacted, and the Academy awarded Smith his first Oscar. Setup, build, punchline, if you will. It was such a nothingburger that even thememesweremid.\nBut somehow, this headass moment became a nipplegate-level event. Insufferable takes flooded newsfeeds and opinion pages. Analysts (slightly) adjusted their valuations of the Smithfamily brand. Pearl clutchers lost feeling in their hands. The involved parties got in on the action too, this being showbiz. Jada writes about the incident in her 2023 memoir. Rock releaseda specialabout it. AndBad Boys: Ride or Diereferences it in aterrible action scenein which Smith gets slapped. Get it? There’s never been any reason to care about any of this, but Smith has taken the outsized cultural response to heart. He spends his first album in two decades glossingthe emotional workhe has done post-slap, insisting that others too can rise from the ashes… of slapping Chris Rock.\nHe never acknowledges that the whole situation is silly, though, instead dressing up the dumb fallout from a dumb gaffe as a grand teachable moment. The resulting music is excruciatingly corny, a cringe ringer of therapy platitudes, youth-pastor smarm, and showtune production that reeks ofHamilton. If the slap was Smith crashing out,Based on a True Storyis him veering off a cliff while shouting, “I can fly!”\nSmith has always been a herb on wax, so some cheese is expected. At the peak of his musical powers, in the late ’90s, he was the emcee parents could understand, the universal chaperone to pizza parties and school dances. In jiggy raps, he found the perfect vehicle for his megawatt charisma and sly rhythmic finesse. But the rizz is long dead, leaving behind a herky-jerky flow. He sounds likeRecovery-eraEminemon these belabored tracks, on beat but never at ease—sweaty, as gamers say.\nHe’s stilted on jokey opener “Int. Barbershop - Day,” which begins, “Will Smith is cancelled,” and proceeds to make you wish it was true, just so he would stop embarrassing himself. The skit, inspired byComing to America,aims for “I Love Kanye”-style self-deprecation, but comes across as delusional: “I ain’t tryna call him lazy, I’m callin’ the nigga crazy/One classic album, what that make him? Jay-Z?/Jay-Z plus movies and TV,” he raps, assuming the role of his imagined peanut gallery. Not evenThe Boondockscould come up with dialogue this surreal."

    "review_text": "For any DJs playing in urban pockets of South Florida for the first time: Please don’t queue “Take a Step Back” when you feel like you’re losing the crowd. Put on DJ Chipman’s “Beam Ahhh” instead—afast-pacedstaple anchored by a genius flip of Eamon’s “On & On.” Its chipmunked refrain and plucks of guitar hit like spoonfuls of epinephrine; within seconds, everybody’ll startstickingandmovinglike those tall ass car wash floaties.\nFrom Homestead to Palm Beach, “Beam Ahhh” was a dance music touchstone for Black babies coming of age in the 2000s and beyond. Naturally, when that classic Eamon sample appeared on ST6 JodyBoof’s new tape,UW6,I stopped in my tracks. “On and on and on/On and on and on,” it goes, cycling under seismic kicks and a woozy MIDI flourish. Jody’s version, titled “Over and Over,” is murkier and heavier, punctuated by the bullish jabs he throws at whoever he’s beefing with. “Ain’t really been slidin’ ‘cause the opps been hidin’/Nigga it ain’t nowhere to go,” he chirps. Thematically, it's a far cry from Chipman’s sugar-coated euphoria, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t crank.\nST6 JodyBoof has climbed the ranks of DMV street rap since late 2023, dumping iron-fisted disses over twitchy, bass-heavy beats. As sprawling as the DMV scene is, it’s so insulated that researching artists like Jody can feel like butting into conversations not meant for anyone else. The realness of his music paints vivid enough pictures, though. JodyBoof regularly addresses dudes by name in his lyrics, whether he’s calling his opps out, throwing dirt on the deceased, or demanding somebody’s freedom.\nOn camera, Jody likes to conceal his face withshiestiesand COVID masks, injecting an air of mystery that plenty of rappers strive for nowadays. Of course he’ll get on Instagram Live totalk shit, but you won’t find any interviews or much biographical info online. In turn, hyperlocal YouTube pages and forums compile evidence of any signs of life, new or old: pictures, videos, beefs, snippets, macabre origin stories.\nOnUW6, his lyrics are cold and dour, unflinchingly firm in the face of violence—the beats he raps over are the complete opposite. The ten-track, 18-minute suite is full of arrangements that twinkle withProject X-type ecstasy. Listen to the ultraviolet synths of “Marty” flood out like they were shot from a confetti gun, or the cartoony glee fizzing out of “Madbudz” and “Nowhere to Go.” It’s the kind of dynamic that makes modern drill music so accessible for the casual listener: carnal, out-of-body fervor is dressed up in alluring, glitzy textures. Either you separate yourself from the calls to violence, or you channel them into emotional release. Jody’s tight-knit cabal of producers—particularly DMV labrats SJR and forest milan—handle the bulk of the instrumentals, equipping him with some of the most buoyant beats I’ve heard this year. As “BTA” sees JodyBoof take off on a high-speed chase, the spacious rhythm of its blown-out 808s sound like something that'd make SheLovesMeechie hit them folks about a decade ago.\nDespite very slight changes in form, none of Jody’s verses onUW6feel phoned in. They aren’t flawless—in true DMV fashion, he emphasizes the last syllable in literally every bar—but it’s never boring. The cut-and-dry emphasis on guns and drugs would feel more redundant ifUW6’s frantic energy weren’t so meticulously controlled. Jody’s motor-mouthed frenzy on “Nowhere to Go” is relentless, and the scrappy verve of “Know Bout Me” makes up for a beat that sounds like aKen Carsonb-side. When he slows the delivery in his signature pocket, like on the tape’s first two tracks, his words start to permeate the membrane. “Told Driz just ride/We gon’ catch one, all you gotta do is just float,” he imparts on “Over and Over.” He’s coaching his homie through a drill like a man would teach his son how to fish. It’s unsettling, but I can still see myself in a crowd with this song playing, allowing the rhythm to take hold. Suddenly it all sounds like dance music."

    "review_text": "Jennifer Lee has always risen to the challenge. Better known asTOKiMONSTA, Lee came up in the late-aughts L.A. beat scene, gaining cred for her smart sampling and adroit drum programming at Project Blowed and Low End Theory; she later became the first woman to be signed toFlyLo’s label Brainfeeder with 2011’sCreature Dreams. Lee’s beats were innovative, sometimes mixing the textures of Korean instruments with spaceship arpeggios. In 2015, a life-threatening brain disease temporarily robbed her of the ability to hear music, but once she recovered, she locked right back into producing. Then, just as she was ready to drop her latest album,Eternal Reverie, she took on full-time care duties for a beloved friend with terminal cancer, postponing the record’s release and tour until this year.\nIn recent years, Lee’s once futuristic, lumbering sound has moved toward a smoother strain of EDM-lite that’s more in keeping withZHUor Elephante thanJ Dilla, leaning into the soporific side of her early bedroom productions even as she has sharpened her drops for the big stage.Eternal Reveriecontinues in the same direction, mostly replacing swung rhythms with four-on-the-floor house and disco beats, and conjuring hazy sunsets in swirls of synth and guitar. It’s pleasant, but rarely goes beyond the retail slickness that has characterized Lee’s recent work. Longtime collaborator Gavin Turek gives a tame vocal performance on “Lucky U,” competing with a ubiquitous “Think” break that has surgically removed James Brown’s characteristic yelp.Anderson .PaakprotegesGAWDtry to kick some life into “Switch It” with sultry triplets, but the restrained pace and telegraphed flow are more Dr. Seuss thanIce Spice. When they ask, “Why you so boring?” they might as well be addressing her programmatic snare rolls.\nEver the omnivorous listener, Lee brings in some global rhythms, though her grooves don’t feel as fresh as they used to. “Corazón / Death by Disco, Pt. 2,” the sequel to a track from her breakout albumMidnight Menu, gives a Brazilian disco sample the filter-house treatment. But while older tracks like “Simple Reminder” defamiliarized Brazilian rhythms by infusing bossa nova beats with cosmic textures, “Corazón” merely sprinkles a tamborzão on top. “All In” looks to Afropiano for inspiration, with just enough silverware percs and shakers to give us a hint of Nigeria, but not much else.\nEternal Reverieblends into the background so easily, it’s hard to fathom that this is the same producer who once worked on anoise-ridden anti-nuclear protest songwithOtomo YoshihideandRyuichi Sakamoto. But any iconoclastic spirit long since gave way to more crowd-pleasing instincts—a tendency that seemingly reached its telos with her recent forays intoNFTsand aweb3-driven streaming platform. It would be nice to hear a new record that returns to TOKiMONSTA’s more experimental roots."

    "review_text": "Often the best way to get to the essence of the American psyche is through the logic of dreams. In a scene towards the end ofTwin Peaks: The Return, an FBI director played byDavid Lynchrecounts a recent one where he meets Monica Bellucci (playing herself) outside of a cafe. “We are like the dreamer who dreams, and then lives inside the dream,” she says with a smile, then grows urgent: “But who is the dreamer?” The music is uneasy as Lynch, with a small U.S. flag pin fixed to his lapel, turns around to see himself from many years ago. The scene is a non-answer to the questions of the series, where narratives spawn narratives and dreams spout from dreams. But it does make you wonder—do we, the people, hallucinate the American dream together?\nThe music of Alabama’s Johnny Coley draws from a similar well. The 74-year-old poet narrates the songs of his third album,Mister Sweet Whisper, as if he’s guiding you through a landscape he’s inventing in real time, a world that blurs the binary between “real” and “unreal.” Coley was born in Alexander City and lives in Birmingham, where he is presently homebound in an assisted living facility. There is a transcendental shimmer to his plainspoken lyrics, which Coley improvises and delivers in a slow, thick drawl, whispering close to the mic. His stories unfold along interstate highways, dark alleyways, wild nightclubs, or inside a Chattanooga Dunkin’ Donuts at 2 a.m., told from the perspective of a man just passing through.\nHere Coley is backed by a crew of young musicians playing as The Sweet Whisper Band: members of the Alabama labelSweet Wreathwho laid downMister Sweet Whisperin a single day, recording the music in studio, then recording Coley’s spoken poetry at his apartment. They’ve dubbed their moody, occasionally dissonant sound “nightmare jazz,” a scary/sexy mode whose skronking sax and vibraphone are of a kin withThought Gang,the early ’90s jazz experiment of David Lynch and his longtime composer Angelo Badalamenti. Lynch would conjure up scenes, then talk the musicians through them until they’d caught the vibe, while Badalamenti narrated surrealist tall tales in a voice so demented it made Lynch laugh until he got a hernia.\nBack to that Chattanooga Dunkin’, where Coley thumbs a ride with a truck driver heading south. Over the slow simmer of “Hitchhikin,” the pair crosses into Alabama in the dark. “We passed a small frame house, completely aflame/Transparent with fire,” Coley rasps, dealing his words out slowly as the music becomes stranger: a clash of upright bass and one comically unhinged horn we come to understand as the sound of frightened geese scattering into the dawn. Is this a distant recollection? A metaphor? A dream? “I don’t have a great memory,” said Coley in a recent interview. “I never did, but now that I’m 74, it’s a memory that doesn’t want to hold anything captive. It wants everything to go free.”"

Even the falsetto howl that pierced the mix in the middle of “S P E Y S I D E” sounded like an echo from the frozen nowhere of his mythic past.\nSABLE, fABLE, his fifth album as Bon Iver, casts those songs—and the Bon Iver project as a whole—in a new light.SABLEis carried over whole to serve as the prologue, three uniformly deep-blue songs introducing an album of kaleidoscopic color. What follows onfABLEis joyful and immediate, as Vernon rhapsodizes about rebirth and romance in ways that would have seemed impossible even a few months ago. It is a genuinely surprising pop and soul record from an artist who has spent half a lifetime searching for new modes of expression. AcrossfABLE,he sounds unrestrained and irrepressible, as though he’s purging some ecstasy he’s kept at bay for years. This is not an album cluttered by shadows.\nVernon has been orbiting the word “fable” in his lyrics for years, though it’s always had a negative connotation, as though the mythic was something to be rejected or fought off. On “8 (circle)” from22, A Million, he implored whoever was at the other end of the song to “say nothing of my fable” before rounding back on himself: “I’m standing in your street now, and I carry his guitar.” There was the sense that Bon Iver’s foundational story, that journey into the frozen nowhere to makeFor Emma, Forever Ago, had been repeated so many times that Vernon couldn’t identify with the protagonist anymore. That wasn’t his guitar he was carrying.\nHere, on “Awards Season,” the last track of the prologue, he plays the fable off against the “sable”—deepest black, dressed for mourning. He absorbs it as an identity: “I’m a sable/And honey, us the fable.”Heis the abyss. In aninterview withThe New Yorkershortly before the EP’s release, he said that adopting sable as an identity in that line was a way of questioning whether his heartbreak was self-inflicted. Perhaps he had been “pressing the bruise[...] steering this ship into the rocks over and over again.” His pain brought him two Grammy Awards, sold-out arena tours, and the admiration of some of the world’s biggest pop stars. That’s powerful positive reinforcement."

With his swanky flow and ability to inhabit multiple characters on the same song,Slick Ricktold madcap stories of all that can go wrong—crooked cops, dope fiends, boring jobs—when you’re just a young dude in New York tryna’ hangout, get a lil’ bread, get laid, and fall in love. His storytelling was real as hell (is there anything more relatable than when he shoots his shot with Mona Lisa by buying her a slice of pizza?) and straight out of a fantastical comic strip at the same time. But like many of the hip-hop pioneers of the 1980s, he isn’t endlessly mythologized in cross-generational online conversation nowadays, nor is he the mega-rich Roc Nation brunch mogul that some big ’90s rap superstars became. If that’s the kind of thing you value, then it didn’t help that for a large chunk of the ’90s, while the genre was in the midst of a commercial boom, Rick was in jail on an attempted murder charge.\nBy the time he returned to form with the pretty goodThe Art of Storytellingin 1999, he was an idolized veteran in his mid-30s in a radically changed rap landscape. He went 26 years before dropping another full-length release. That release isVICTORY, a short, stylish legacy album born out of boredom and an apparent itch to jog the memories of anyone who might’ve forgotten that this rap thing wouldn’t be the same without MC Ricky D. “Had cats stayin’ in Clark Wallabees, I did that/When brothers was drivin’ Benzes I pushed them into Rolls Royces/Posh behavior, I did that,” he says on a spoken word interlude, over the soothing sound of waves washing the shore.\nVICTORYis also part of Mass Appeal’s big plan to cash in on rap nostalgia with aseries calledLegend Has It, in which the zine turned multimedia company and record label (co-owned byNas) plans to release seven new albums by seven rap legends. These are the kinds of records that sound like message-board folklore: a joint tape by Nas andDJ Premier, a sequel toSupreme Clientele, and newMobb Deepand Big L.

Built around the South London artist’s guitar, that album’s long stretches of scouring, sand-blasted, mostly beatless instrumental music at first didn’t seem to have much to do with dance music. But just as grime incorporates rap but is culturally divorced from hip-hop, so, it seems, has Klein developed a style that centers loud, hyper-compressed guitar chords but is far removed from rock. Twenty-five years ago it might’ve been called post-rock, but now it’s in conversation with a microverse of experimental guitar music written in the language of modern radio rock, bone-dry production and all: the seven-string architecture ofML Buch, the ecstatic riffing ofJoshua Chuquimia Crampton, the hypnotic slam-metal ofTorture, the 2D post-hardcore ofMoin.\nthirteen senseis Klein’s second album in this style, and it’s fierier and more expansive than its predecessor while still inhabiting a timbral space somewhere between the nastiest black-metal demos and the most godforsaken trenches of post-millennial nu-metal. While the 17 tracks onMarkedfluctuated wildly in volume and texture, this shorter, tighter album stakes out a corner of the midrange and fills it. Everything flows by in a horizontal and dull-colored stream, like a river winding its way through a polluted landscape. Klein uses her guitar primarily as a noisemaker, but she wields it more confidently than ever, filling “double life” and “nobody sees what the tree knows” with billowing shoegaze chords suggestive ofBorisat their most in-the-red. Even the tracks that sound like idle shredding are more carefully composed than they let on; listen to the shimmering keyboard arpeggios undergirding the thick fretboard smears on “role of fear.”\nIt’s easy to readthirteen senseas a deliberately transgressive and provocative work—a millennialMetal Machine Music.The cover is hardly reassuring, showing a scribbled figure either hanging from the ceiling or recreating the end ofThe Blair Witch Project. But what lingers in the mind oncethirteen senseis over is its undercurrent of quasi-religious awe. The passages that aren’t dominated by amp noise make room for mournful pads and wintry static, and when a church organ whirrs to life on “eternal,” there’s a real feeling of cold, numinous beauty. Klein’s cited inspirations always cycle back to the music of her late-millennial upbringing: not just grime, but the gospel andColdplay-adjacent soft rock she heard from her mom (could the title be a nod to the post-Britpop also-rans Thirteen Senses of “Into the Fire” fame?) and the R&B on the radio in the 2000s. These influences shine through, however abstractly, in the album’s quiet moments."

Beneath it all, the books themselves, and their pages—grazed by fingertips, rustling as they turn, breezily falling together as the covers thwack shut.\nIn 2001, as part of a series calledSix Degrees: Art in the Libraries, the Los Angeles multimedia artist and composerSteve Rodencreated an installation made entirely of the sounds of books and paper being touched and manipulated, which he then reworked digitally into an otherworldly stream of richly textured sound.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Roden was at the forefront of a loose movement dedicated to coaxing unexpected sounds out of everyday life by harnessing contact mics, electrical interference, and happenstance. His work was adjacent to a strain of digital minimalism known asmicrosound, but he preferred the term “lowercase,” which he described toThe Wirein 1997: “small music that is humble, that allows the listener to discover it, to wander round in it.” In a world growing noisier by the day, he believed, “This is a more subtle and subversive way of getting people to pay attention.”\nThe piece was quintessentially Roden; he had built his entire art practice on the quotidian, the marginal, the ignored. Deeply invested in the possibilities of translation and mistranslation—not just between languages, but also between media or even senses of perception—Roden’s work frequently revolved around objects, interiors, and landscapes. The 1997 piecesplint (the soul of wood)was made entirely out of the sounds of striking, bowing, and rubbing a1943 plywood leg splintby Charles Eames; 1998’slamp (within​/​without the skin)took a similar approach to a1952 bubble lampby designer George Nelson. Not all his readymades came with fancy pedigrees: 2002’swinter coupletwas sourced from two teacups and played back through speakers connected through cardboard tubes, while 2006’soionos, an installation for a rustic Athens church restored by the architect Dimitris Pikionis, incorporated tin whistles and toy harmonicas.\nMany of Roden’s pieces,Forms of Paperincluded, have a kind of meta sensibility: For 1999’sView, he created a gallery installation out of sounds sourced from the ledge of the gallery window, a sonic equivalent to the room-sized pinhole camera. But the principal throughline in his work is its abiding quiet—combined, perhaps, with the idea that deep inside all that hushed rustling, an indecipherable language is trying to make itself heard. That’s certainly the case withForms of Paper, which betrays little hint of its tactile source material; its liquid burbling and keening resonance sound more like an amplified underwater soundscape, a cryptic field of ocean currents and dolphin cries, swarming krill and hermit crabs scuttling along the seafloor."

    "review_text": "There’s asceneat the start ofGame of Thronesthat lingers in the back of my mind. Two knights are jousting for an audience of royals, aristocrats, and commonfolk. One of them, the brolic, seemingly unstoppable “The Mountain,” suffers a shocking loss to Ser Loras, the effeminate Knight of the Flowers. Embarrassed and incredibly pissed off, the Mountain decapitates his horse with a massive sword. Spectators can’t do anything but gasp. This is the nature of medieval bloodsport; unless you’re willing to put your life on the line, you accept it for what it is. This is also the lay of the land according toZukenee, the latest in Atlanta’s lineage of rap-game world-builders.\nIf you’re sufficiently entrenched in this underground rap scene, you already know the character archetypes: theandrogynous vamp, thebloodthirsty demon, thenonchalant bag-chaser. It’s all just role-playing, foreal. But this sense of predictability makes it interesting when someone presents something half-original, like using dungeons and dragons as metaphors for what goes on in the trenches. Zukenee’s latest full-length,SLAYTANIC, transposes gold-grilled bravado and block-level anecdotes to medieval theatre, solidifying his role as rap’s newest knight in shining armor.SLAYTANICbuilds on the motifs of last year’sBIRTH OF ST. SLAY,a well-rounded breakout that broughtTheLegend of Zeldato the Dirty South (peep “Flannels”). A month after its release, Zukeneeperformed“Mary Kate” at Rolling Loud with silver gauntlets on his wrists and a hype man wearing chainmail; in themusic video, he lights a spliff with a wax candle. Sometimes you’ll catch him and his “slayers”totingswordslike Jon Snow. You get the point.\nSLAYTANICis bookended by its two strongest tracks. “Cut Ya Hand” begins with a scrappy fiddle loop that works way better than it should over classic trap drums, as if the court jester was too goofy to realize he’s playing off key. “Cut ya hand, shake my hand,” Zukenee raps, setting the scene with a blood pact. By virtue of natural charisma, he threads between myth and reality. The production, helmed by Cade and Desmos, helps blur those lines: Pay attention as the lush flutes and tip-toeing keys on “Nun” drop out and hooves clop past. Left with nowhere to go on outro “In the Woods,” Zukenee seduces a girl in nature’s embrace.SLAYTANICis full of tongue-in-cheek, braggadocious lyricism, but occasionally a cogent metaphor veils Zukenee’s vulnerability. Sex is the first thing on his mind, but when he laments, “The village burned down/I miss my neighborhood,” it’sreal-life gentrificationthat lies within sight."

    "review_text": "From the sound ofSPELLLING’sPortrait of My Heart,Chrystia Cabral’s heart is sugar, spice, andChemical X. It’s angels onAngel Dust. It’s all the music you’re lucky if you got into as a younger millennial: nü-metalcore breakdowns,Pepper Annpop-punk, mungy Cali funk metal, cheap-seat arena rock, and orchestral goth grandeur, with a fugitive whiff of Goapele’s East Bay classic “Closer” perfuming the air.Tracey Thornonce theorized thatthe heart remains a child. Here’s a record that kicks and screams to prove it.\nCabral describesPortrait of My Heartas an album about “love, intimacy, anxiety and alienation,” and the 33-year-old Bay Area artist paints these emotions as so powerful that the natural world cracks and bends to their will. Love is like a flood, loss is like a hole opening in the sky. “It’s unreal, what the heart can hold,” she sings on “Waterfall.” It’s easy to detect a narrative of a breakup followed by tentative new love as kiss-offs like “Alibi” lead into the new dawn of “Destiny Arrives” and “Mount Analogue,” but Cabral hasn’t been specific about the personal circumstances at play. What matters is that you can project the weathers of your own heart onto her music—that one of the songs onPortraitmight mean as much to you as much as “You Oughta Know” might’ve meant to the generation before Cabral’s or “Good 4 U” to the generation immediately after.\nThese romantic-outsider yarns fit nicely with Cabral’s persona as a modern-day mystic, drunk on her own strangeness. When she sings “I don’t belong here” on the title track, we can read it as a literal expression of alienation, as a reference toone of the great angst anthems, and as a complement to the gleeful eccentricity that animates her music. We might read it on another level, too: Cabral is a Black artist of Mexican descent, and she’sspokenof dealing with her feelings of otherness as a kid by “growing my outsider-ness as a superpower.” Like all the great glam icons (Bowie,Prince,Gaga,Grace Jones), Cabral doesn’t revel in kookiness for the hell of it but to demonstrate how to take control of one’s own narrative.\nPortrait of My Heartbrings in outside producers for the first time, including Rob Bisel, who’s worked withSZA, and Psymun, who’s worked withYves Tumor. These earlier credits are relevant, the former as the kind of acerbic singer-songwriter superstar who thrived in theMorissettianmid-1990s, the latter as a denizen of the noise underground who breached the upper echelons of indie acclaim without losing their mystique. The hooks on “Alibi” and “Keep It Alive” hit with scream-along jollity, even if Cabral’s punk turn means we get less of the fairytale quality that made her earlier work bewitching—and even if the drums sound curiously flimsy at times, crushed underfoot by the guitar onslaught."

    "review_text": "Horsegirlopen their second album,Phonetics On and On, with a question. On the jaunty “Where’d You Go?,” singer-guitarist Penelope Lowenstein poses that titular query and is immediately answered by singer-guitarist Nora Cheng: “Far, far, far away.” No longer high schoolers, the members of the Chicago-formed indie-rock trio moved across the country for college, temporarily abandoning that city’s nearly fairytaleyouthscene. While drummer Gigi Reece, the oldest of the three musicians, crafts zines and waits for the others to graduate, Lowenstein and Cheng have immersed themselves in their English majors at New York University, fawning over linguistics and using the new album as a sonic playground to rearrange syllables.\nPhonetics On and Onis a home-away-from-home album, capturing all the freedom, uncertainty, and change that comes with the replanting of a flag. Trading vocal duties on songs, Lowenstein and Cheng sing about awkward crushes (“Well I Know You’re Shy”) and the ambiguities of adulthood (“In Twos”), albeit in the cryptic language of a heavily redacted diary. Through those blacked-out passages emerge peculiar characters, like a welder righting a pipe or a shepherd driving a flower truck because it smells nice. When Horsegirl do switch into first person, their habits masquerade as Gen X realities: waking up to the radio, shaking hands when parting ways. Though Horsegirl have never lacked confidence, lyrically they seem caught in a fog; if you like that opacity as much as they do, then swatting through the air to find sharper meaning is a brain-teasing classroom exercise.\nConsider their constant use of non-lexical vocables like “do” and “fa la la.” Those aren’t just harmonic filler, though they function exceedingly well as such in Lowenstein and Cheng’s minimalist delivery, but rather an intentional deconstruction of the building blocks of language. Hence “Information Content” operating like a guidebook to the whole album. Cheng explains her textural choices (“I’m translating my talk to tones”) and encourages listeners to develop their own interpretations or get lost in the blank space (“All you got’s ahoo ahoo ahoo/’Cause all I give’s ahoo ahoo ahoo”).\nMuch of Horsegirl’s initial heralding, especially the critical enthusiasm forVersions of Modern Performance, stemmed from how astutely theystudiedindie rock legends and obscure ’90s bands, going so far as to hostSonic Youth’s Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley on that album. Though the trio dreamed of—and succeeded in—getting signed to Matador,Phonetics On and Ondrifts towards the softer, rubbery twee of Flying Nun,Electrelane, andStereolab. The country twang over acoustic strumming on “Frontrunner” and the chipper vocal melodies of “Switch Over” draw a line to Horsegirl’s newfound appreciation for classic songwriters likeBob DylanandAl Green. Horsegirl remain standout students when it comes to music history, but the band’s application of its well-honed taste rarely feels like cribbing."

    "review_text": "Kali Uchisisn’t the first singer to place sensual pleasure at the top of her priorities, but in an era when contemporaries likeKehlaniandSZAcomplement the body talk with self-scrutiny, Uchis’ one-track mind feels as fresh and necessary as a cold beer after a walking tour. Using a high raspy flutter to project sex-drunk bliss, the Colombian American singer-songwriter hits a peak onSincerely, her fifth album of candy-colored reveries and gossamer love-me-downs. At the midpoint betweenDiana Rossreveling in a love hangover andAaliyahrocking the boat, Uchis’ music offers the equivalent of extended foreplay.\nSincerelyis also, I must say, monotonous, like other people’s happiness can be. “Yeah, there’s angels watching over me,” she sings late in the album, and well, good for her—we all need comfort in dark times. On last year’sOrquideas, co-produced by a formidable brigade of Latin talent that includedEl Guinchoalongside Geeneus and longtimeKendrick Lamarcollaborator Sounwave, Uchis sang more or less the same kinds of songs in her patented husk-sigh but in Spanish, her second such full-length album; this difference made the difference. Singing in her first language released more nuances of expression than even the excellentRed Moon in VenusandIsolationknew how to spotlight. It had tonal variety to its love songs—call itSongs for Lovers Who Swing. OnSincerely, though, Uchis delivers a 45-minute monologue without so much as a look out the window for distraction.\nA glance at the tracklist confirms her mood. She’s upbeat! With an exclamation mark! On “Sugar! Honey! Love!,” Uchis pushes her voice to ceiling-scraping heights over strings playing a faintly Indian melody to celebrate the kind of experience that can only happen to people like her: “And I did all my time/For a crime that wasn’t mine and made it out alive.” On the Miracles-indebted chug of “Daggers!” this openly bisexual artist nods towards the love that dare not speak its name; she and her angel babe “sweet as cherry pie” will make them turn their heads everywhere they go, like the would-be couple in the Ronettes’ queer-coded “Be My Baby.” Josh Crocker, who co-produced 2023’s “I Wish You Roses,” is back with “Lose My Cool,” a five-minute refutation of its title, for Uchis’ talent is to keep her cool in moments of surrender.\nUchis’ producers serve their client without fail. Few instrumental embellishments distract from her vocals, alas, and when they come, like the prominently mixed bass guitar on “It’s Just Us,” they’re welcome. “ILYSMIH” demonstrates this team’s talent for using the studio as instrument—a bit of echo here, a keyboard ripple there—for the sake of a valentine to her baby with partnerDon Tolliverlast year; nothing can penetrate this gauze-covered cocoon of sound. Otherwise tracks like “Breeze!” don’t deserve the punctuation, and “All I Can Say” depends on some acquaintance with girl-group traditions.\nSincerelyplays better as a whole rather than as tracks excerpted for a playlist, which is fine, though “Sugar! Honey! Love!” and “Daggers!” rank among Uchis’ most lived-in tracks. Besides, albums as guileless and hermetic asSincerely, recorded by ambitious artists of relative youth, tend to look like a moment’s monument to a joy that they have no way of knowing is transient, and if it isn’t, well, that’s fine too. Kali Uchis will on future albums figure out a way to explain her bliss to the rest of us with the variation it deserves.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Every live release by the National comes with some self-sabotage. First they recorded theHigh Violettrack “Sorrow” for six hours; then a straightforward but uninspiredfull-album rendition ofBoxer; then adeliberately low-quality cassette releaseinspired by bootlegger Mike Millard. They’ve somehow gone a quarter-century without releasing a regular, gimmick-free live album, which makes a certain sense: The National took so long to hit their peak that they’re simultaneously in the prime of their popularity and their play-the-hits late period. While their early-aughts New York City contemporaries were, as Matt Berninger put it in the33 ⅓onBoxer, “doing some wild, clinging-to-adolescence vibe,” the National kept their heads down and toured relentlessly. “Can someone tell me how the National suddenly became the biggest band in the world?” an incredulousBrooklyn Vegan bloggerasked when they sold out a five-night run ahead ofBoxer’s release—because they’d never acted like it.\nInstead, underdog status became a part of the band’s identity, particularly an infamousAlligatortour where the National played tohalf-empty roomsafter the buzzier opening act,Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, left the stage. Their 2010s popularity coincided with an increased appetite fordepressionand dissociationin popular music; the artier and tenser the records got, the more people found them, untilAaron Dessnersomehow became a successful pop producer. Live, all that tension is finally released: the five-piece, accompanied by Ben Lanz and Kyle Resnick on horns and auxiliary instruments, amp up every single song so that there’s always a climax around the corner. Berninger screams lyrics he only muttered in the recording booth; Bryan Devendorf comes out from underneath the drum machines; the Dessners turn up the distortion until the National actually sound like a rock band. Somewhere between the stage andLong Pond, their music gets smoothed out, even though simmering intensity is part of the appeal.\nThat makesRomeboth a victory lap and a concession: the National admitting how big they’ve truly become. Recorded in the Italian capital’s Cavea at Auditorium Parco della Musica Ennio Morricone this past June, it’s a sprawling 21-track live record, with a setlist for die-hards waiting on the rock album the band hasteased for years. Piano ballads like “Pink Rabbits” and “Light Years” are set aside in favor of early, heavier tracks fromAlligatorand one from 2003’sSad Songs for Dirty Lovers.Even the ballads (“Our other kind of song,” Berningeronce put it) end in triumphant fanfares and drum fills.Romeis an accurate and engaging, if not always flattering, display of the band least likely to break out of 2000s indie."

    "review_text": "Philadelphia producerEev Franceshas covered a lot of ground in four years. A given Frances track might be built out ofrave stabs,Memphis-style beats, orMerzbow-gradenoise blasts, any one of them looped and compressed into a blunt-force instrument; her more elaborate productions have taken the form ofbrooding post-dubstep,yearning shoegaze gabber, andmisty-eyed jungle. No matter the style, the common denominator has been an omnipresent patina of damage: blown out, bitcrushed, and bristling with distortion, as though her DAW were buckling beneath the surfeit of ideas.\nFrances’ new release,Sometimes I Forget to Breathe, marks a shift. The outlines of her music are more vivid—the beats have sharper teeth; the melodies glint like the backs of dolphins. If her early work often seemed like a kind of primordial soup, the new record fast-forwards a considerable distance through her music’s evolution. So long, protozoa: Here we see the creature fully formed, striding confidently into the wilderness.\nIt’s not just that the music sounds more polished; everything about it is more intricate, more carefully thought out. One influence looms large: the hyperkinetic blasts of late-’90s and early-’00s IDM. The opening “Pistol Whip (Demo)” is a riot of barely restrained energy. A furious drum’n’bass rhythm assembles itself out of clattering cutlery; calming pads keep the mood placid while the bassline tangles itself into increasingly contorted shapes. There’s something almost cartoonish about the squelchy textures and crystalline tone colors, but the giddiness is tempered by a more downcast undercurrent. As the track builds, the melodies grow hydra-headed, branching into contrapuntal chaos. It’s an unabashed homage togolden-ageSquarepusher, but it holds its own in its sheer depth of feeling.\nA similar palette and stylistic sensibility carry across most of the record. “Burstintotears” spends its first three minutes tossed by a wistful chord progression that lurches like butterflies in the stomach; a tinny crash cymbal announces a climactic drop and the arrival of a rushing, reassuring kick drum. (The title is self-explanatory.) “Blistex” is an atmospheric sketch for burbling synths; “Bala Cynwyd” channels them into a spring-driven electro anthem festooned with lush pads, metallic delay, and another bassline so squelchy it practically leaves soggy footprints where it lands. Frances’ music, despite the blasted surfaces and often breakneck pace, has always had an unabashedly emotive bent, and here she puts her feelings front and center. Suffused in video-game bleeps and chords that refuse to neatly resolve, it’s nostalgic and hopeful all at once."

    "review_text": "Listen back toEthel Cain’s 2022 debutPreacher’s Daughterand you’ll hear glimmers of the bold turn into dark ambient she has now taken withPerverts. Around the edges of the widescreen shots of ambivalent American life crept deep, disorienting terror; the Florida-born artist may have swung for the fences with the cavernous snare and pearly guitar tones of “American Teenager,” but she also groaned against a loop of buzzing flies in the opening bars of “Ptolemaea.” Her second LP now zooms close on the rot undergirding her Southern Gothic storytelling. Splayed betweenNurse With WoundandGrouper, it sheds the cathartic American songwriting traditions that earned Cain a dedicated following among sleep-deprived Tumblr kids andformer U.S. presidents. There are no more open roads or dreams of escape in this dimly lit hell. WhilePreacher’s Daughterspilled with expansive landscapes, detailed scenes, and plenty of characters to populate them,Pervertsholes up in theBlair Witchbasement or the hermetically sealed house ofSkinamarink. It’s 89 minutes of claustrophobia and dread attenuated by gentle clearings. What scant relief it offers comes in whispers.\nThe album opens—courageously and brilliantly—with a terrifying 12-minute title track. Full of warbling hymns, indecipherable dialogue, and gaunt silences, “Perverts” is the kind of recording that might well take on a life of its own as creepypasta, believed to curse and haunt its listener, much likethe Caretaker’s music did in 2020. When you hear a garbled voice issuing a command you feel compelled to obey or else, and you can’t make out at all what it’s saying? That’s good horror. Right off the bat, “Perverts” plunges you into the stew of your own anxiety.\nBetween spoken-word ruminations on sexual shame—“Masturbator!” Cain spits from the shadows—emerge slow-burning songs of delicate intimacy. Her voice has never sounded better than it does on “Onanist,” “Punish,” and “Amber Waves”; multi-tracked over the smog of distorted guitars, it scrapes off the lacquer that clung to it on earlier releases. By releasing herself from concrete narratives and pop payoffs, Cain veers into some of her most complex and emotive vocal performances yet. A song like “Punish” doesn’t tell a story you can imagine on a movie screen, but it does constellate profound feelings of nausea, rejection, and powerlessness. “Nature chews on me,” Cain muses against reverberating piano, a slight voice pressing against the great maw of the world.\nPervertsis an awful lot to take in one sitting, and it often feels split between two distinct aesthetic modes: the wistful chill of slow but structured songs, and the brutal unmooring of eerie ambient collages. Both styles converge thematically on the same tortured core, but the switch between them can cause whiplash. On the 13-and-a-half-minute “Housofpsychoticwomn,” an artificially deepened voice repeats “I love you” to the point where it starts to sound like a threat—a rumination on how love can manipulate and punish its object as easily as it can comfort. Immediately after that exercise in white-knuckling, the album transitions into the jarringly gentle “Vacillator,” which rises shining and clean, by comparison, from the toxic swamp.\nIfPreacher’s Daughtercast a penetrating lens on the violence embedded in the institutions of the church, the couple, and the nuclear family,Pervertstightens Cain’s scope to the lone, distraught human body. American Christian upbringings warn against physical pleasure, inculcating a fundamental conflict at the level of the senses. The body seeks and rewards sexual release; the church condemns it; self-loathing weaves into self-satisfaction.Pervertssifts through the psychic wreckage of that conundrum. Cain has always rendered triumph from abjection. Here, she discards the impulse to soar out of darkness and opens her mouth to let it in instead."

    "review_text": "To build your own Haunted Mound, the NorCal rap collective founded by the ghoulishly gaudy rapper-producer Sematary, you’ll need the following essentials: undying affinity forChief Keef’s clattering drill,Salem’s anesthetic witch house, andYung Lean’s pitchy emo-rap; a deep reference bank of horror flicks and occult mythology; and more blood-stained True Religions than Mark Zuckerberg has gray T-shirts. With his long-awaited debut solo mixtape, the spectralOctober Country, original Haunted Mound member Ghost Mountain posits: What if the truest religion of all is the friends we made along the way?\nThe tape arrives six years after Sematary and Ghost Mountain christened Haunted Mound with the inauguralGrave Housetape, and four years since Ghost Mountain acrimoniously split from the collective, quitting music altogether to pursue film school. In the years since, Sematary and his other associates (Buckshot and Hackle) have grown Haunted Mound into an underground phenomenon. While Sematary’s music has gotten harsher and more eclectic as his popularity has ballooned, his brags about cutters and Cadillacs have become as predictable as hitting the same haunted house three times in one season. His bombastic style has been missing its atmospheric foil since his and Ghost Mountain’s 2020 tape,Hundred Acre Wrist, where Ghost Mountain’s comparatively subdued vocals—more drainedWicca Phasethan demonicGucci Mane—and cryptic lyricism provided a crucial counterweight to Sematary’s gargling splatter raps.\nAfter privately reconciling with Sematary, first as friends, then as creative collaborators, Ghost Mountain announced last year that he’d returned to Haunted Mound.October Countryreckons with Ghost Mountain’s sudden departure and even less anticipated return to the studio, a story directly intertwined with his fractured-then-mended friendship with Sematary. With the two sharing executive production duties,October Countryfunctions as a victorious reunion that rekindles their chemistry and revamps Haunted Mound’s palette with a tasteful elixir of backroad goth, chimeric folk, and hooky emo-rap. It’s the most sophisticated project either musician has ever been involved in, and it sets the bar for witch house revivalism just as a post-Snow Strippersdeluge of vacant pastiche is due to flood the zeitgeist.\nAlthough Sematary’s presence looms large overOctober Country’s autumnal production (Haunted Mound regular Oscar18 also contributes heavily), the record is very much a Ghost Mountain affair and plays to his strengths. Even Sematary’s sprightliest songs buckle under the weight of his deep-fried horrorcore delivery, butOctober Countrytracks like “Kismet” and “By the Flame” are genuine pop tunes where Ghost Mountain’s vocals soar weightlessly atop the shattered synths and mucky guitars. In “Hovel,” his moans float like aCurechorus, and in “Wayside,” his wispy harmonies swirl around the hook like lost souls. Haunted Mound’s elders,Bladeeand Yung Lean, arrived at a similar nexus of stoic post-punk and melty emo rap on last year’sPsykos, but just as Los Angeles deathrock was to UK goth in the early ’80s, Ghost Mountain’s Americanized take on the idiom is grittier and more phantasmically stylized than his European counterparts."

But it didn’t take long for Palm members Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt, plusNicks and Grazesproducer Matt Anderegg, to make their comeback. The trio had been putting out music asKassie Krutsince 2020, but their October single “Reckless” was a formal reintroduction, announcing itself with a sing-and-spell hook that became the band’s calling card and rallying cry. Their self-titled debut EP preserves traces of what made Palm great, but it also reveals what they were, just maybe, always meant to do: make dance bangers.\nOnNicks and Grazes, Palm piled their aerobic rhythms high with junkyard scrap drums and Alpert and Kurt’s chantlike harmonies, which at times could sound uncannily likeAnimal Collective’sPanda BearandAvey Tare.Kassie Krutstrips almost all of that away. The beats remain, more mechanical than before, as does Alpert’s voice, though here it becomes a robotic cipher, accompanied not by Kurt but (as on “Reckless”) what sounds like a male text-to-speech bot. Sometimes, Alpert is just another texture in the mix; on the shuddering, immense rager “Hooh Beat,” razor-sharp sawtooth synthesizers slice her words into their individual phonemes and morphemes. “United” is Alpert’s most surprising turn, because she comes across neither menacing nor aloof, instead delivering her lines in the hypnotic, sing-songy patter of a children’s nursery rhyme. It’s a love song (Kurt and Alpert are recently married) that perfectly captures the way infatuation can strike you dumb to the point of Dadaism.\nWhileKassie Krutis in many ways an exercise in minimalism—“We challenged ourselves to write a song with one bass note, one drum beat and just a couple simple chords,” the trio originally said of “Reckless”—traces of Palm’s proggier inclinations still shine through. Winding ribbons of zither-like guitar open and close “United,” and “Racing Man” pulls a magic trick where the bass pulses sound at first like they’re on the offbeat, forcing you to recalibrate your inner metronome in real time. At just over a minute, “Espresso” is the EP’s shortest and least essential track, a deconstructed noise experiment that more closely resembles the music ofArcacircaMutantor one of the interstitials fromSOPHIE’sOil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides. Kassie Krut are clearly thinking about their project as mind music as much as for the body."

It happened when she was 11, she thinks, after a confusing night kept awake by a series of loud barnyard noises coming from her parents’ bedroom. Miserable, the next morning, as to why mom and dad were playing dumb at all her questions about their obvious racket, she chose to reenact everything she’d heard right there at the kitchen table. She made hiccupy gasps, rammed the dinette into the wall like a headboard, moaned, whimpered, and slurped. When at last mom knelt at her side and managed to quell this desperate, heaving child, our heroine looked at her with tears in her eyes. “I heard you,” she said. “You saidgive it to me hard.”\nI admire this story, and not just because it ends with her mother explaining human intercourse to her over a bowl of shredded wheat. I admire it because it makes clear that the problem with growing older is that it proves just how much there is that you don’t know. Adulthood’s irregular flow of revelations will lead you to the awful conclusion that there will always be something to confuse or torture you anew, and guidance, should you be so lucky to get some, often comes by way of a vessel not of your choosing.\nSensibly, legions of former children have elected to find relief in the steadying baritone ofJarvis Cocker, who, at 61, has spent an entire career mapping the funny, endearing, and usually nightmarish discoveries of pubescence (and post-pubescence, and post-post-pubescence) with his band,Pulp. Across two decades—and nearly four now, with this new album—Cocker has become a laureate of genitalia and the brains that wire them; a psychodramatist of families and the thin-walled homes they live in; a reliable soap-operatist of the hormonal human condition. “I ended up documenting my puberty through pop music,” he said, not long ago. “I wanted it to go through puberty with me.”\nThis is a monstrous understatement. If we were to print Pulp’s entire lyrical oeuvre in one reader-friendly manuscript, the lay analyst would find a songwriter not only locked in the phallic stage, but trapped in an entire phallic theatre. Sex is Pulp’s thing: How one can get it, if there is more of it, and whether or not it can happen tonight. The first- and third-person narrators of Pulp tracks are chained to these premises, and not infrequently effecting some sort of sexual misdemeanor in their pursuit. There is a lot oftom-peepingand notableupskirting, stories in which whole cities reachorgasm in miraculous unison, erotic epics that seem to speak directly from the crotch. (This is a discography given to world-historical song titles like “Underwear,” “My Erection,” and “Can I Have My Balls Back, Please.”) With a sort of lothario suavity picked up second-hand from Engelbert Humperdinck, orBryan Ferry, orSerge Gainsbourg, rare is the Pulp track without a dose of hornysotto vocemuttering, sharp sexy inhalations, Cocker squealing likea hog in heat."

    "review_text": "Wile E. Coyote stops and looks at the camera, a resigned expression on his face. For an agonising second his feet scramble to gain purchase on solid air, the cliff edge now meters behind him. Then he plunges to his (temporary) doom. Unlikely as it may seem, this moment of comically absurd cartoon drama is precisely whatMapambazuko,a collaboration between Peruvian musician Alejandra Cárdenas (akaAle Hop) and Congolese guitaristTiti Bakorta, sounds like: outlandish, frantic, bounding with color, and pushing at the edges of possibility.\nThe album melds Cárdenas’ hallucinogenic and ultra-bright Latin rhythms with Bakorta’s joyful soukous-inspired guitar lines, as heard on his 2023 albumMolende—a combination that might sound improbable on paper but makes perfect sense once heard. Bakorta’s playing may be born of improvisation, but he creates melodies that stick in the head with gluey insistence.\nThe album consists of six original collaborations between Cárdenas and Bakorta, plus three additional remixes. The original songs essentially follow the same pattern. Bakorta solos, his playing as delicate, free, and wild as a bombardment of small exotic birds (not for nothing does the album have a song called “La Danza del Pajarito,” or “the dance of the little bird”). Cárdenas supplies crunching drums, odd noises, psychedelic effects, and a general air of chaos. The adventurous spirit is reminiscent ofAgua Dulce, her 2023 album with Laura Robles, even if the sound is very different.\nThe combination is potent and deliciously evocative. On the ultra jubilant “Bonne Année,” Cárdenas’ detuned electronic horns and semi-industrial thump are reminiscent of a factory assembly line gone ecstatically rogue; on the title track, Bakorta’s scrabbling, weaving sunshine guitar is like a crab scuttling off on honeymoon; “Una Cumbia en Kinshasa” has the jaunty lurch of a boat party on warm, choppy waters.\n“Así Baila el Sintetizador” is particularly hallucinatory, the tempo climbing another notch as Bakorta’s guitar explores a curiously downbeat melody and Cárdenas adds berserk synth streaks. The song’s madness suggests an influenza superspreader party, as attendees’ temperatures punch through their limits and the sweat starts to drop. It’s sick—but a lot of fun. The tempo only drops on “Nitaangaza,” a woozy stroll through cough-medicine land that sits somewhere between dub reggae skank and psychedelic rock action.\nThese songs are immaculate. The remixes less so, with all three takes upsetting the duo’s delicate balance. Cárdenas’ dub-heavy remix of “Una Cumbia en Kinshasa” submerges the guitar lines in overly fussy production effects; the chirps, squirts, rumbles and splashes distract from the melodic madness, rather than supporting it. Remixes from Kenyan ambient artistKMRUand London-born, Chinese-Malaysian producerFlora Yin-Wongrip Bakorta’s guitar out of the heart of the songs, leaving a massive void at the heart of the duo’s work."

    "review_text": "Probably a lot of people were introduced to Baltimore-born, Germany-based songwriterSophia Kennedythis year throughDJ Koze. She’s the muffled, distorted voice you hear on “Die Gondel” from his monumentalMusic Can Hear Us(and she’s signed to his label, Pampa). While thrilling, that track’s not representative of Kennedy’s solo work, which now numbers three albums that could vaguely be classified as pop—“too underground for the pop world and too poppy for the underground,”she’s called it—but of a diffident and understated sort. In 2025, the “art-pop” designation has become a huge tent, where radio hitmakers and slightly synthed-up folkies and hyperpop brats and no-nonsense experimentalists with full CVs all crowd in on the defining basis of having melodies. Yet Kennedy’s unusually thoughtful compositions would better fit outside that tent, in the chill.\nKennedy recorded her latest LP,Squeeze Me,with long-time collaborator Mense Reents. Both artists have spent over a decade in the German pop and experimental scenes—Reents is particularly prolific as a remixer and sometime solo artist—and share a knack for playfully lo-fi, sometimes MIDI-based experimentation, mostly unbothered by trends. WhileSqueeze Meisn’t “cinematic” exactly—the album’s too subtle for such a pat label—it follows a loose cinematic arc, moving through a series of genres to experiment both with style and with levels of emotional remove.\nThe push-pull between intimacy and distance, playfulness and poise, vulnerability and withholding characterizes much of Kennedy’s work, primarily through her two distinct vocal styles: her low register, which channels the imperious force ofGrace Jonesor Happy Rhodes, and a gentler mode that has the knowing, insinuating warmth of Karen Carpenter or Barbra Streisand. OnSqueeze Me, that theme is also textual. The title is something Kennedy snagged off the tag for a kids’ toy, finding the phrase evocative. It can be a flirtation of the Betty Boop kind—or one more specific about its tactile actions. But the words can also signify something much harsher: squeezing like a vise, or like the last few drops out of a vessel.\n“Nose for a Mountain” is the prelude to the album’s story: an earnest metaphorical reflection on early adulthood that likens Kennedy’s aging mother to a landscape within which she continually has to resituate herself. The song has a steady rhythm and sophisticated poise, but above all is deeply earnest—the lyrics even referenceBambi.Afterward, the album retreats from that vulnerability hard. “Drive the Lorry” ischilly like mall air-conditioning, an arrangement of a practically vestigial reggae beat among various clicks and pulses whose assured lyrics—“You don’t need someone to walk you down the aisle/You’re the aisle”—Kennedy delivers like amusements rather than platitudinous girlbossing. “Rodeo” manages to extract sangfroid from a metaphor about cowboy tricks and a vocal of multitracked yodeling and cuckooing."

    "review_text": "The defining image ofTom Waits’ early career is aphotograph taken by Mitchell RoseforRolling Stoneat the Tropicana Motel in West Hollywood in 1977. The singer-songwriter had been renting a room there for a few years by that point, but the photo looks like he’d moved in an hour ago. Beer bottles litter the coffee table in front of him; a guitar case rests atop an oversized cardboard box. Waits leans forward, hands folded, looking skeptical, maybe a little put-out, but certainly not embarrassed by the shabby condition of his domicile. He’s sitting in a folding lawn chair that hasn’t seen a ray of sunshine since the Nixon administration.\nThe next year, Waits put out his sixth LP on the Asylum label,Blue Valentine. The imprint, started by David Geffen and Elliot Roberts in 1971, was a showcase for the Southern California talent that was defining the post-Woodstock singer-songwriter landscape.Judee Sill’s debut album was its inaugural release,Jackson Browne’s with his first record a few months later, and by the timeJoni MitchellissuedFor the Roseson Asylum in the fall of 1972, Asylum sat near the center of a scene that was becoming a movement.\nWaits knew some of these people from shared bills and the scene revolving around the Los Angeles club the Troubadour, where he’d been discovered by manager Herb Cohen. But he didn’t quite fit in. The prevailing mode of the early singer-songwriters was personal expression—you were supposed to draw from your life for your material, dotting your lyrics with references to friends and lovers and changing the details just enough to maintain plausible deniability. Waits wasn’t interested in this kind of sharing. Instead, he turned the whole idea on its head and based his life on his songs.\nLike so many in his cohort, his early encounters withBob Dylanblew his mind. Where many of his peers came up playing in garage bands, learning how to play Beatles tunes and “Louie Louie,” he fashioned himself as a solo songwriter from the beginning, and Dylan was his North Star. In the 2009 biographyLowside of the Road, writer Barney Hoskyns describes Waits’ earliest performances at a local folk society’s hootenannies as little more than impersonations, where “he was so in thrall to the staple Dylan persona that he wore a harmonica around his neck without ever putting his lips to it.” But where others copped the style and tried to write lyrics that could be considered poetry, Waits channeled the elder artist’s drive for reinvention. By the time he was making a name for himself at San Diego folk hoots, his middle-class suburban upbringing in Whittier, California, suddenly became irrelevant: Music was a good way to become someone else."

It might also be a barrierML Buchhas thrown between herself and her fans.Suntubtook five years to make, and it was only the Danish musician’s second album. An unruly situation arises: Will the reverence with which fans currently treat Buch as the indieverse’s motherdu jourcurdle into scorn if she doesn’t deliver on schedule? People are already getting antsy. The demand for art pop from continental Europe is through the roof, and strong 2024 records likeAstrid Sonne’sGreat Doubt,Milan W.’sLeave Another DayandMolina’sWhen you wake uphave all been saddled with the unfair burden of being dubbed successors toSuntub’s throne; one imagines she slept a little more easily afterdumping these tracks on YouTubea few days before Christmas (they’re also available as bonuses when you buySuntubthrough Bandcamp).\nTo be clear, this is not the nextSuntub.Nor is it a glossy deluxe edition, likeJazmine Sullivan’sHeaux Tales, Mo’ TalesorSZA’sLana, that deepens and complicates the original release. Buch doesn’t sing at all on these six tracks, a fact she riffs on in the YouTube album art, which shows the field of grass in the background of the original cover with her face edited out. She’s made no effort to present it in the neat package of an album or EP, though you could argue a neat package isno longer a requirementfor something to be considered an album or an EP. It’s 15 minutes of material from theSuntubsessions—take it or leave it. There’s no reason not to take it.\nFour of these tracks feature no recognizable instruments other than guitar, but her tone is so distinctive that we’re instantly thrown intoSuntub’s world, or maybe a small uninhabited moon orbiting it, from the opening notes of “Sway walking.” ThinkTom Scholzby way of “Watermelon in Easter Hay” by way of Buckethead’sElectric Tears, playing music at the intersection ofJoni Mitchell’sHejiraandBoards of Canada’sGeogaddi. Attempts to classify Buch’s sound tend to unspool into messy lists like these, none of which do justice to the uniquely uncanny quality she brings to her music."

But they’re probably doing just fine as they are: organizing club nights and parties like subglow in Berlin (where the former Seattlite currently resides) and putting out dubby, moody mixes likeA Night in the Skull Discothequefor the T4T LUV NRG label. Apart from this year’s collaborative EPTilda’s Goat Stare, this is CCL’s first proper solo production. Containing three tracks plus a remix and two edits, the record plunges you into their warped, sweaty haze of hypnagogic, id-melting beats.\nThe EP is presented as an “ASMR murder mystery,” a theme that plays out in occasional spoken-word fragments. But as a framing device, it’s pretty loose—imagine you’re in a cobwebbed library, exceptwait, it’s a strobing club—and not particularly indicative of the sounds being explored. Mostly the music consists of reproductions of styles like speed garage and breakbeat 2-step, at times sounding as though they had been beamed straight out of the late ’90s and early aughts. CCL’s haunted delivery of certain lines—especially “Dreams, the original thrill,” on highlight “The Plot Thickens”—sounds like they want to give the vocals the flickering, phantasmal feel of a vintage sample, like the stuttering movie soundbite on KMA Productions’ stark “Cape Fear.”\nRather than rewire these genres or insert unexpected left turns, CCL gives them new layers of both polish and psychedelic clutter. Tracks quiver like gothic piñatas, spilling out astral arps and burbles that pop like goblin borborygmi. “Strange Attractor” unfurls like a full night out, warping from icy ambient to subterranean trance, with clattering breaks folded in as an extra layer of ornament. This is music for the heads, and for DJs who’ll listen to the micro-textures and envy the deft way CCL weaves this buzzing hive of elements without overloading the groove.\nClearly the result of perfectionist tweaking,Plot Twistglides seamlessly between genres, as though walking between club rooms engulfed in fog. At points, the mix begins to melt into a feverish ooze, the club walls collapsing as the drugs hit. “We’re standing in a library,” a voice coos softly like an apparition amid the 2-step stutter of the title track. “I watch you take a book from the shelf. Pages turning softly,” they continue, before the voice echoes and accelerates, sounding almost inhuman. But the tracks never fully dissolve into chaos; CCL’s locked-in grooves keep you from dissociating in the mist. These tracks feel like they’re made to be dancefloor artillery, the kind of deep churners that set the mood, yank people off benches and out of the bathrooms."

    "review_text": "Kai Slater, the 20-year-old guitarist and co-vocalist of rising post-punk bandLifeguard, edits and produces a zine calledHallogallo. Named after a song by Krautrock pioneersNeu!and inspired by punk and mod revival zines from the ’80s, it is painstakingly handmade, detailing and in turn fueling a brilliant young DIY art-punk scene in Chicago that’s generated bands likeHorsegirl,Friko, and Post Office Winter. Lifeguard’s debut albumRipped and Torn—itself named after an early and influential British punk zine—is curious and exciting in all the same ways asHallogallo. Though its medium and methods might be familiar, the album is made with such intensity and conviction that it feels essential: This is the rare modern album that makes indie rock sound life-changingly important.\nThe thrills emerge suddenly and don’t let up. “It Will Get Worse” begins with a lazy guitar and haymaker cymbal crashes that could easily have been borrowed from the last album by young post-punk prodigies to feel this vital,Parquet Courts’Light Up Gold. But the pace changes on a dime and races forwards, propelled by Isaac Lowenstein’s skittish drums and Asher Case’s devastatingly simple bassline. Slater’s guitar is a serrated blade, top-end and atonal, but he pulls back the moment it’s called for, switching to sliding octaves like a spindly young Tom DeLonge. He sings “no one around here” over and over again, a mysterious but simple lyric that sticks to the song like freshly gored chewing gum. Halfway through he eschews lyrics entirely and replaces them withla-la-las, demonstrating a refreshing and well-earned confidence in a three-note melody.\nIt would be easy for a band like Lifeguard, particularly one so young, to fall into noise for noise’s sake, hammering the same atonality to mask a lack of imagination. Instead, they focus on their hooks, which often appear from nowhere. The shifty monotone of “Like You’ll Lose” stutters into a surprisingly mournful-sounding chorus, while the harder-edged “France And” breaks into a refrain consisting of two notes and three individual words: “Oh, oh/I am, I am.”\nIn fact, a theme throughout the album is how good both Slater and Case are at singing “oh” sounds, either as part of a word or just on its own. Slater’s voice is higher and raspier, better suited to the power pop he channels and the music he makes alone asSharp Pins; Case’s deeper, icier voice is directly influenced by the ’80s new wave bands he loves. But they both pronounce “oh” with a cultivated nonchalance that bursts through the compression on the mics. It ties them to the history of this music—evidence of pop and punk having gone back and forth across the Atlantic countless times over the past 50 years. But it’s also evidence of a truth Lifeguard seem to understand on an elemental level: There’s no need to clutter up a mix or overwrite a song when you can make a vowel sound that good on its own."

The pioneering hyperpop she released in the late 2010s under ahead-spinning number of aliases; the transmissions that—along with those ofJane Remover,Dazegxd, and others—created the digicore subgenre earlier this decade; the introspective innovations of her first two LPs, 2021’sdrive-by lullabiesand 2022’squinn; and a multitude ofalbum-length idea dumpsandbite-sized collabsare drastically different but unmistakably hers. Her December mixtape,stars fell on trench, feels less immediately revolutionary than her earlier records. After five years spent exploding and rebuilding her signature sound, quinn’s vocabulary is more familiar than it once was: The music isn’t any less radical, but there’s more context for it now.\nstars fell on trenchis a collage of clashing samples and bars that alternate between razor sharp and deep fried. On opening track “terms and conditions,” a gospel choir gives way to layered, pitched-down samples of Bernie Sanders, which fade slowly as the hook ofProject Pat’s “Out There” steps into the spotlight. Pat’s pitched-up voice continues to loop quietly as quinn’s enters, at once animatronic and oddly warm. Far-flung as these sounds are, they feel natural together, like she’s lived in them for a while. “I could never fade away, won’t settle till I’m 30,” she raps from a cozy pocket in the now-settled instrumental.\nLater on, quinn samplesUsher’s “U Got It Bad,”Ne-Yo’s “So Sick,”One Direction’s “Night Changes,”Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse,” andSnoop Dogg’s diatribe from “The Chronic (Intro),” among other, less immediately apparent sources. Using clips so recognizable they transcend sample-snitching may be trendy, but quinn slaps her raw materials together at odd angles no one could replicate. Her voice slides below and above them in the mix, at home in the misshaped creases.\nstars fell on trenchhas a few holes: A blown-out trap flip of a cloying emo-pop tune on “it’s nothing” strikes the wrong balance between dissonance and shlock. The repetitiveCranberriessample on “zombie” is far less inventive than the rest of the record’s production. But these misses are outnumbered by the tape’s many inspired moments—a chaotic mid-album track based around aLatin TikTok remixofPlayboi Carti’s “2024” or a reimagining ofbeabadoobee’s “1999” as a willowy harmonic component of a heart-racing, sidescrolling instrumental."

    "review_text": "For a star who’s been publicly unlucky in love,Selena Gomezhas a surprisingly rich catalog of love songs. There’s the title track of her 2015 album,Revival, whose subject basks in the romantic glow of self-discovery. Herbiggest hit to dateis a profession of tenderness for a woman rising from the ashes of heartbreak. You see what I’m getting at: Gomez has historically been the object of her own affection. And while so-called “empowerment pop” always runs the risk of corniness, the details of Gomez’s biography have made hers feel earned. Resilient in the face of vicious scrutiny of her relationships and health struggles, Gomez became both a credible mirror to her listeners’ pain and a beacon for their shot at redemption. While her peers spend their days furiously plotting performances of vulnerability, Gomez may be the most convincingly down-to-earth pop star we have.\nAll of that transformative, hard-won self-love has unlocked a new era for Gomez; these days, her love songs have a different object.I Said I Love You First is her seventh studio album and first full-length collaboration withBenny Blanco, to whom she is recently engaged. Blanco and Gomez’s professional relationship extends back at least a decade, to when he co-wrote and produced some of the more radio-oriented singles onRevival. He may lack his fiancée’s seismic celebrity, but Blanco’s fingerprints are all over modern-day pop: A former Dr. Luke protégé, he’s behind No. 1 hits by the likes ofKaty Perry,Maroon 5, andJustin Bieber. Even so, such behind-the-scenes players rarely get co-billing with A-list singers. Here, the gesture clearly serves the album’s meta-narrative: Selena and Benny are in love, and their love is a meeting of musical minds. Mazel tov to the happy couple.\nAbsent this meta-narrative,I Said I Love You Firstis quite scattershot, an odd collection of songs that sound like other songs, incongruous spoken interludes, and one random reggaeton track (“I Can’t Get Enough”) first released in 2019. In interviews, Blanco and Gomez underscored the ease with which the album came together. They worked on it at home, in bed, they said; in light of the results, this has had the unfortunate effect of making me more sympathetic to return-to-office mandates. The record opens with Gomez speaking about growing up and embracing change, in a clip lifted from a farewell address to the cast of her Disney Channel showWizards of Waverly Place, then launches into a lament for her youth. It ends with a twinkly little paean about the fragile nature of love. In between, the loosest outline of a narrative arc traces the fading of one relationship into another."

    "review_text": "“Three chapters. Three geographies. Three different producers.” Sitting in a Goan cafe on New Year’s Day 2023,Anoushka Shankarscribbled out the key tenets of her latest project—a trilogy of “mini-albums,” each anchored in one of the places the sitarist and composer has called home. There was just one other ground rule. She promised herself that she would enter the studio without a roadmap in place, fully open to all possibilities.\nThat blank slate represented a risky approach. All of Shankar’s most notable releases, beginning with 2005’sRise—her first non-classical album, and her first as a composer—have been marked by stylistic experimentation grounded by a strong narrative framework. Ripping up the blueprint that she’d stuck to for almost 20 years was a gamble.\nBut the approach paid off, resulting in Shankar’s most emotionally resonant and stylistically innovative body of work yet. Each release in the triptych exists within a distinctive sound-world, shaped by its specific location, emotional contours, and collaborators. Their only connecting thread—apart from Shankar and her sitar—is a loosely-defined day-night cycle, denoted by the use of time-specific ragas. But considered all together, a compelling emotional arc emerges.Chapter I: Forever, For Nowis a stirring exploration of finding joy even in the throes of personal trauma, sparked by the memory of a rare afternoon spent with her kids in the garden of her London home. The moody drones, sepulchral reverb, and twilight-hued sitar ofChapter II: How Dark It Is Before Dawn, meanwhile, evoke the Pacific Ocean at night—a sanctuary for introspection and healing.\nThe series’ final instalment,Chapter III: We Return to Light, moves us into the dew-washed sunshine of a fresh day. Wounds have been licked, demons exorcised. The long, difficult night has left its scars, but the emotional trajectory is now aimed upwards and onwards. This renewed sense of purpose is most audible in the return of percussion: Time, largely kept at bay in the first two chapters, resumes its onward march, as wistful reverie gives way to movement and action.\nOpener “Daybreak” sets the scene, sun-dappled sitar tracing languid loops over Alam Khan’s sarod, before Sarathy Korwar’s feather-light percussion brings in a sense of urgency and forward momentum. “Dancing on Scorched Earth” layers crunchy, low-octave sitar riffs over a funky backbeat, conjuring visions of the nocturnal Goa forest raves that Shankar frequented in her 20s. Leaning even further into those Goa trance influences, “We Burn So Brightly” is a fever-dream of oscillating drones, tropical drums, and frantic sitar shred. If Shiva ever landed up on a contemporary dance floor to dance thetandava—a divine dance of creation and destruction—this is what I imagine would play in the background."

The five-piece is among the most experimental new voices to emerge in British guitar music in the 2020s, and onCowards, Squid’s third album in only four years for Warp, they cast their gaze wider than ever. Their 2021 debut LP,Bright Green Field, was a frothy-mouthed post-punk diatribe against capitalist drudgery and Britain’s slide into far-right politics. The jazzier, looser 2023 follow-upO Monolithcast a wider net, placing the visceral moment ofBright Green Fieldin its broader social context, engulfing topics such as police brutality, ancient British folklore, and the UK’s relationship with rats.\nCowardscould be seen as the final instalment in a twisted trilogy: This time, Squid zoom out even further, taking as their subject matter evil itself. Looking well beyond the immediate UK context, here their kaleidoscopic post-rock refracts all the ugliest impulses of humanity—cowardice, apathy, greed, and bloodlust. Lead singer and percussionist Ollie Judge hasdescribed the record as“like a book of dark fairytales.” By turns ominous and luxurious, it’s the band’s most restlessly expansive listen yet.\nSquid songs tend to have a metamorphic energy, beginning life as one thing before impishly transforming into something else entirely. OnCowards,this shape-shifting sensibility is more alive than ever: “Blood on the Boulders,” a tale about the Manson murders, is a quintessential example, veering between discordant, rapturous screams and a cloying whisper that sits on the skin like California heat. On the dyad of “Fieldworks I” and “Fieldworks II,” a whimsical processed harpsichord provides a direct juxtaposition to percussion that ticks like a clock, generating an enveloping sense of dread.\nIn most of these songs, Judge’s lyrics foreground an antihero: a brutish, Old Testament God-style figure who acts as a counterpoint to the music’s mischievousness. “Building 650” dovetails a playful guitar lick with the story of Frank, a “nice guy” yet very bad man who the narrator cannot bring himself to cut ties with. Meanwhile, over beautifully coruscating synths, “Crispy Skin” tells the story of a living in a society driven to cannibalism (“It’s become so easy,” Judge sings about tucking into human flesh). And “Showtime!,” an explosive five-minute musing on the manipulations of fame, takes on the voice of a Warhol-esque figure who promises to make you a footnote in his story. Embodying this sinister character, Judge’s vocals prowl, dark and low like smoke, over the funhouse mirror surface of glitching electronics and juddering strings."

    "review_text": "The title ofMacie Stewart’s second solo album,When the Distance Is Blue, is borrowed from Rebecca Solnit’s essay “The Blue of Distance,” a meditation on longing. The Chicago composer and multi-instrumentalist’s album, an eight-part suite of improvisational chamber ambient, is tinted by the limpid colors of an in-between space, peering across absence without attempting to resolve or subdue it. Her pieces for prepared piano, string quartet, voice, and field recordings drift weightlessly; with minimal tools, Stewart crafts multitudes.\nThe album began with Stewart’s improvisations on piano, her first instrument, which she prepared in the studio with contact mics and small objects. It took further shape as she started incorporating recordings from an archive of audio documents gathered during a year on the road, channeling the perpetual ungroundedness of touring into aqueous shapes, and hoping to “evoke a nostalgia for something I wasn’t able to name,” she has said. “No matter where I am, there’s always something that’s far away from me,” she told aninterviewer. But her collaborators here—friends and fellow members of the Chicago experimental scene—keep her rooted. Extemporaneous cello from longtime collaboratorLia Kohlenlivens album opener “I Forget How to Remember My Dreams”; on “Murmuration/Memorization,” Kohl’s cello andWhitney Johnson’s viola blend with wordless vocals, Stewart conducting the air like a choir. Swelling drones saturate the atmosphere, broken only by pointillist plucks near the track’s end.\nThe central presence of piano and a lack of lyrics setWhen the Distance Is Blueapart from nearly everything else in Stewart’s varied catalog, save for her2020 recordwith Kohl. There are only minimal traces of her art-rock duoFinomor the cross-pollinated folk of her solo debut,Mouth Full of Glass. Instead, stripping away the complexity of her previous work, she sounds inspired by the nuanced focus her collaborators have shown on albums like Kohl’sThe Ceiling Reposesand Johnson’sSonescent.\nLead single and album centerpiece “Spring Becomes You, Spring Becomes New” is both lush and exploratory, built around repeating piano figures and bell-like chimes. Stewart’s collagist approach succeeds whether she is improvising with a trio of other players (Kohl, Johnson, and double bassist Zach Moore) or overlaying vocal improvisations recorded in a Parisian apartment building (“Stairwell (Before and After)”). She is magnetized to the uncertain, unknown, and uncomfortable, observing textured, complex terrain and rendering it in sound.\nA pair of field recordings were born from Stewart’s desire to draw the world around her into the music. She recorded “Tsukiji,” flooded with voices and shuffling footsteps, at the Tokyo fish market of the same name; when a car engine emerges, it sounds almost musical, buzzing high above the din. Recorded at the Osaka airport, “In Between” is a microcosm of transience, droning strings swimming through a sea of conversation. Though fleeting, these interstitial tracks help to sustain the album’s spiritual core, informing the slow presence of the longer pieces."

But the mood has progressively lightened since then.Nudy Land,the Atlanta rapper’s breakout, finds balance between macabre texture and gut-busting humor; while you wait for wings at the“Barbecue,”Nudy wants to “slap meat on her grill.” 2019’sSli’merre, his first official collab tape with Pi’erre, peaks with“Sunflower Seeds,”a guitar-driven track serene enough to put a toddler to sleep. Now, after five years ofsoloventuresand RIAA plaques, they’ve reappeared withSli’merre 2,a lukewarm collection of drug-and-sex anthems that, unfortunately, could putyouto sleep.\nAcross the sequel’s 16 songs, Young Nudy’s streamlined delivery sits rigidly atop Pi’erre Bourne’s all-too-familiar production quirks. The final boss music of “Gotta Salute,” theBilly & Mandysynth swirls of “Money,” and the bubbly chimes of “I’m Big Dawg” feel like eating the old candy your grandma offered from the bottom of her purse: stale, trite, kinda obligatory. The cartoony soundboard thatoncemadePi’erre’s production lucid and vibrant is tirelessly repurposed, while Nudy’s signature gusto gets bogged down by vapid clichés. “I have no worries, hakuna matata,” he inflects on a track named after theLion Kingmotif. “Gotta feed my family (gotta feed the fam)/Any means necessary, I don’t give a damn.” Oh, we know. In the words of habitual shitposterHyperpop Daily,Sli’merre 2isFull Tummy Music: a stockpile of uninspired, industry-grade fodder put out for the sake of keeping the fridge filled. All that’s missing is a “My shooter keep a 30 like Curry” line."

    "review_text": "ForJuana Rozas, forgiveness is overrated. On the Argentine singer’s new album, a clubby tribute to the chameleonic sounds of the Latin rave underground, her titular protagonist would rather throw a drink in someone’s face than keep quiet—she’s all for making a scene. And against the electro-maximalism ofTANYA’s world, it feels better to beef.\nRozas’ 2022 album,Vladi,explored a bubblier, more celestial palette. Her ethereal vocals and the songs’ short runtimes channelledPinkPantheress’ bedroom pop confections, never sticking around long enough to get heavy.TANYAswaps out the cutesiness for anger. The club isn’t just a place to giggle with friends in the bathroom; it’s an opportunity to let off some steam.\nRozas is a rising star in Buenos Aires’ pop landscape, which revels in artifice, excess, and irreverence. She found her creative stride attending queer perreo raves after years of playing in the male-dominated Argentine rock scene. Alongside fellow porteñas like collaborators Six Sex and Chita, Rozas is carving out space for femme and queer experimentation. Their success coincides with years of feminist organizing in the Argentine music industry, including passage of a law to require a mandatory quota for women on festival lineups.\nAlthough the heavy beats ofTANYAare meant for raving, the lyrics aren’t exclusively hedonistic. Apart from “BAD CHOICE,” an electrifying ode to saying “fuck it,” Rozas is more concerned about relationships outside the club. She understands that sweating it out is often the best way to cope. She thirsts for her toxic on-again-off-again fling on album highlight “ANTONIO,” writing about a guy she can’t bear to shake. Her voice run through harsh distortion, she admits she’s looking for someone to trap her. The crashing beats bleed into a sugary electronic whirlpool. It’s as if she just hit her stride on Rainbow Road and pushed the other racers into the abyss.\nMuch ofTANYAexists in a similarly feverish intensity. “UN ÁNGEL” feels like losing control of your body in the flow of a crowd, its jittery electronics spiraling into discord. Rozas leans into her penchant for gothic imagery, winking at the devil on her shoulder: “Posee un crucifijo dentro de su valija/No tengo confesiones, pues nunca he pecado/Solo mentí un poquito para estar a tu lado” (“He’s got a crucifix in his suitcase/I have no confessions, because I never sinned/I only lied a little, to be by your side”). Rozas belts most of her lyrics, but despite the revved-up sound and omnipresent distortion, her voice never slides into monotony.\nTANYAisn’t all restless headbangers. Rozas cages her prickly persona and lets her softer side out to play on the back half of the album. On “RIDĺCULO,” she chronicles a failed relationship alongside Argentine indie rocker Santiago Motorizado over fuzzed-out synths. What begins as straightforward dream pop grows glitchy as it goes, but it doesn’t have the same excitement as her chaotic electroclash. The jarring transition from fiery anthems to longing romantic interludes undercuts the record’s conceptual unity. The quieter moments are more snooze than catharsis. But as a club provocateur, Rozas knows how to craft a heater."

    "review_text": "No one listens toArthur Russelljust once. (Well,almost no one.) If you have heard his music, it is likely that you have internalized his singular voice and unique melodic sensibility, folded them into some innermost corner of your being. He has this effect on people, despite the fact—or maybe because of it—that the vast majority of his fans never heard a lick of his music while he was still alive. Yet this pair of decades-old live recordings reveals Charles Arthur Russell, Jr., gone now 33 years, as you have rarely, if ever, heard him before: just cello, the electrical heat of the microphone, the buzz and sway of a few pedals, a cocoon of empty space around him—andthat voice, unmistakable, ethereal yet embodied, both distant and impossibly close, as familiar as the voice in your head.\nThese reissues come from two tapes recorded atPhill Niblock’s Experimental Intermedia Foundation, a homey loft space in lower Manhattan where Russell frequently performed. He recorded the first on June 25, 1984, at a performance billed asSketches for World of Echo(admission: $2.50), and the second 18 months later, onDecember 20, 1985. Steve Knutson’s Audika label—which in collaboration with Russell’s partner, Tom Lee, has given the world far more posthumous work from the artist than he ever released in his lifetime—first put outSketches for World of Echodigitally and on cassette in 2020; the second live set, now titledOpen Vocal Phrases Where Songs Come In and Out, remained unheard until now. While available separately on Bandcamp and streaming platforms, both recordings have been paired on a2xCD release, which is appropriate: They feel like segments of a single continuum, snapshots of a long, unbroken moment.\nThese are not unplugged sessions, exactly; Russell was an inveterate tinkerer, and in both sets he fleshes out his cello and voice with a modest battery of effects pedals—stereo delay, reverb, distortion—and a rudimentary tone generator. Yet rather than obscure his playing and singing, those add-ons only seem to heighten the sensation that we are sitting alone in the room with him. There is an uncommon purity to these recordings that suits the guilelessness of his music; it is rare to feel like you have been granted such a direct line to an artist’s mind at the moment of creation. He would later stitch segments from both nights into the 1986 albumWorld of Echo, combining them with material recorded at Battery Sound studios, and some elements are echoed elsewhere in his catalog in radically different forms—the avant-disco masterpiece “Let’s Go Swimming,” famously mixed by Walter Gibbons; the Nicky Siano-produced disco anthem “Tiger Stripes,” which Russell recorded under his Killer Whale alias—but by and large, these recordings are less collections of discrete songs than extended fantasias, improvisational meditations in which lyrical hints and brief melodic figures dissolve in the ceaseless onward flow."

    "review_text": "When Calgarian siblings Patrick and Matt Flegel dissolved their beloved indie-rock bandWomenin 2012, they effectively mined its components like a couple divvying up their assets after a divorce. Patrick imported Women’s uncanny sense of melody into the phantasmagoric pop projectCindy Lee; Matt and fellow Women exile Mike Wallace repurposed the group’s foundation of dissonance and drone for their new band, which would come to be known asPreoccupations. A decade on from their caustic and confrontational early recordings, Preoccupations have evolved in much the same fashion as their post-punk forebears did at the dawn of the 1980s, when the nascent MTV airwaves were filled with former DIY denizens angling for their close-ups. Preoccupations’ fifth album reaffirms what ’80s kids raised onthe Psychedelic Furs,Echo and the Bunnymen, and a steady diet of made-for-TV nuclear-disaster movies internalized long ago: Post-punkispop music, perhaps the only kind that makes sense in a world inching toward apocalypse.\nIll at easeis hardly a thematic stretch for a band whose catalog already includes “Anxiety,” “Pointless Experience,” and “Death.” But this time, Preoccupations express mental anguish and world-weary fatalism with more graceful gestures and, at times, genuine jubilation. The first sound we hear on the album is a frantic door-knocking that feels both ominous and exuberant, and the song that follows, ”Focus,” continues to skate that fine line: While the gate-crashing rhythm matches the distressed, psychoanalytical tenor of Flegel’s lyrics, the mood is brightened considerably by a buoyant chorus hook and aB-52’s-style female backing vocal that lifts the song to ecstatic heights that Flegel’s sandpapery voice wouldn’t reach on its own.\nAs Flegel’s words turn bleaker, the album’s mood turns brighter. “I think we’re ready for the asteroid,” he sings over sanguine motorik synth-pop of “Bastards.” “Andromeda” has him wishing the Earth would hasten itsinevitable collisionwith the titular galaxy, yet it’s an iridescent rocker that suggestsInterpolblazing down a Southern California freeway, capped by a soothing synth line from Scott Munro that beams like the sun over the horizon. The ever-present tension betweenIll at ease’s grim lyrics and grand designs isn’t being milked for irony; it foregrounds a sense of humanity and romance in a world that threatens to turn our hearts to stone. “I can’t believe the apocalypse is taking so long,” Flegel seethes during the strobe-lit,Depeche Mode-esque chorus of “Sken,” before making a poignant pledge: “You’re the only thing that’s keeping me calm.” By Preoccupations’ cynical standards, that practically counts as a love song."

    "review_text": "WhenMIZUperformed at the Noguchi Museum last summer amid the late American sculptor’s playfully imaginative pieces, it felt like kismet, given the Brooklyn-based cellist and composer’s similarly architectural sensibility. On the delightfully soaringForest Scenes, released earlier this year, she used field recordings and digital effects to illustrate a vivid virtual landscape, but on her third album,4 | 2 | 3, she turns toward somber severity.\nMIZU’s music has come a long way from her gorgeous yet straightforward debut album,Distant Intervals, and even the lyrical tone paintings ofForest Scenes, whose embrace of electronics signaled her rejection of the buttoned-up classical world. The grayscale expanse of4 | 2 | 3swims in shadowy reverb, industrial throb, and spartan bowing. The album has its roots in MIZU’s score for choreographersBaye & Asa’s work of the same name, in which the riddle of the Sphinx—What has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?—became a metaphor for humanity’s fraught relationship with technology. Such theatrical scale is second nature for MIZU; her concerts can feel like carefully executed dances, her bowing like a fluttering knife while ribbons dangle from her hair. Her long acrylic nails have become a part of her onstage persona even as her compositions have veered toward the sinister. Her contribution to Baye & Asa’s apocalyptic vision is fittingly muscular and grim; she clearly understood the brief.\nA deeply unnerving quality pervades4 | 2 | 3, which is structured around long, sustained notes and slow, repetitive crescendos. The album’s hour-long runtime gives her more room to play with repetition, variations in phrasing, and whirling drones. Three numbered tracks each offer breathing room—pensive throat-clearings before diving into the next shadowy piece. On more consonant tracks like “Sphinx” and “Rounds,” she pushes and pulls at her material with almost physical force—a given phrase might first sound triumphant, then twist into something mournful, accented by pulsing white noise—while digital glitching erodes the edges of the sound field.\nThe marching rhythm of “Mob” is something new for MIZU; it’s the first time she has worked so explicitly with electronic percussion. The piledriving beats accompany some of the most strident and extreme textures on the record, as panic-inducing drones crescendo. Similarly experimental flourishes color the spectral wash of “Vapors” and the simmering “Stations,” with its unsettling percussive clatter. MIZU’s composition and production are more abstract her than on previous records; whereForest Sceneswas set against a backdrop of field recordings,4 | 2 | 3aspires to the condition of a more elemental kind of sound, ominously monolithic. At least, that is, until the spare and gentle closing track, “The Riddle.” Here, MIZU draws out an elegiac ensemble arrangement before gradually shrouding it in filters and distortion; as it fades, the decaying phrase evokes a dancer winding to the ground at the end of a long performance."

    "review_text": "Have you ever had your world transformed in the span of a cab ride? It happened twice for the New Jersey-born taxi driver Diane Luckey, who in the 1980s began moonlighting as the larger-than-life nightclub singerQ Lazzarus. Her first serendipitous passenger was the late director Jonathan Demme, who hopped into her back seat during a 1986 blizzard on his way back from finalizing the music video for Steven Van Zandt’s anti-apartheid protest rap “Sun City.” Eavesdropping on his discussion with the song’s producer, Arthur Baker, Luckey asked if she could play him her music. Demme was struck by the singular depth and verve of her voice, and a long-running creative partnership was born: Q Lazzarus’ music—along with her cover of the Talking Heads’ “Heaven”—would feature prominently in four of his films over the next decade.\nDemme’s use of Q Lazzarus’ “Goodbye Horses” in the harrowing Buffalo Bill “makeover” scene in 1991’sThe Silence of the Lambslent the spectral synth-pop oddity a lasting cult notoriety; it’s been covered by everyone fromMGMTto theAirborne Toxic Event. Yet Luckey never made a dime from its royalties. Labels allegedly balked at the prospect of signing a Black female rock vocalist, and she washed up as a bus driver in Staten Island after her years grinding as a metal singer in London left her with little but a crippling drug habit.\nOver 30 years later, Luckey picked up another director who took an interest in her talent. After singing along to Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold” with Luckey during a 2019 cab ride, the documentarian Eva Aridjis, sensing a familiar face and voice, took a chance and asked outright if her driver had heard of a singer named Q Lazzarus. Luckey initially demurred; she had purposely stepped away from the spotlight, pointedly refusing to speak tointrepid music reporterswho wanted to meet the person behind her haunting vocals. But just before Aridjis exited the car, she admitted that yes, she was the real Q. Shortly after, Aridjis began work on a documentary about the rise and fall of the enigmatic and elusive would-be rock star.\nAridjis began filming her documentary with the intention of reuniting Q and her backing musicians for a triumphant return (how veryLazarus). But the director’s vision was cut tragically short when Luckey died from sepsis after breaking a leg in 2022. When producers pulled out, Aridjis launched a Kickstarter campaign to see the film through. The resulting documentary,Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus, comes to theaters next month. Ahead of its release, Sacred Bones has put out nearly two dozen remarkably diverse demo recordings Luckey shared with Aridjis with the hope of finally seeing royalties from her music. From spiraling psych rock to headbanging hair metal, these songs showcase Q Lazzarus’ range, rage, and strange, cosmic beauty."

You don’t listen toAethiopesorTurn on the Bright Lightsand think, “Damn, maybe I should play this the next time I have friends over.” These are records you wallow in alone. In 2023, one of my most played songs of the year wasXang’s “for me,” a spacy, desolate track that wrapped itself around me on streetlit walks home. Across two minutes, the Maryland rapper’s breathy, overlapping vocals seep into a spine-tingling haze of keys and muffled bass, casting a chill of unease. Xang’s lyrics are often incoherent, which can be a drawback, but it’s his ability to build an atmosphereuniquetohimthat continues to lure me in; his sludgy drawl unravels on horror OSTs like dark bolts of silk. The 24-year-old artist is an anchor of the scattershot rap cliqueDPM, an online collective that repurposes ’90s ambient (and whatever else they get their hands on) intoskin-crawlingtrackswith tactile percussion. His textures are equal parts alien and familiar: The Frankenstein’dDrakeandWaynebeats he floats over are fitted with awkwardly placed snares and kicks that somehow maintain engrossing rhythms. The producers in Xang’s orbit—ivvys,theo,.cutspace,westly, and countless others—set the tone for a ghastly ambiance that’s amplified by his gruff, brooding delivery.\nWatch Over My Body, orWOMB, is the clearest distillation of Xang’s vision since his emergence in 2021. Nestled beneath his uncanny struggle rap are signifiers of his home soil: the tinny bells on “notice,” the blistering kick drums on “hangman,” the distinctive DMV punch-ins on “by myself.” “cake got baked” has this mischievous, cascading progression that sounds like somethingGoonewandLil Dudewould’ve slid on in 2017. But even with this in mind,WOMBfeatures some of the most off-kilter hip-hop you’ll hear this year; in a recentinterview withThe Fader, Xang simply dubbed it “headphone music.” The mechanical lurch of “paid” fits that label. As wailing livestock and warbling ad-libs pan from left to right, the mood is pensive and restless, almost nauseating. Like a little cousin tobilly woods’ “The Doldrums,” “paid”’s use of acrid sound design in empty space is too surreal to turn away from. It sounds like what a midnight drive through a sundown town must feel like. Xang definitely isn’t the promethean writer that woods is, but the existential gloom in his voice is all the same. “Bitch wanna eat, gon’ sell that box/It is what it is,” he mutters. “Bro wanna eat, but he stuck in a box/It is what it is.”"

    "review_text": "In 1973, the readers ofCreemmagazine votedNew York Dollsthe year’s Best New Band. They also voted them the year’s Worst New Band. The poll succinctly captured the polarizing effect of the group’s brief but marked reign over the Lower Manhattan rock scene, a post-Warhol Factory crowd that flocked to gritty gigs at Max’s Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center. That year, the proto-punk enfants terribles released their self-titled debut and split their niche fanbase into even slimmer factions. There were those who loved the record—including veteran rock critics and Dolls devotees like Robert Christgau and Ellen Willis—and those who felt that the studio environment had sapped their live set and diluted their potent slurry of blues, early rock’n’roll, and girl group melodies.\nAnd then there were the folks who just didn’t like the Dolls to begin with. The press in Memphis clocked their rouged cheeks and platform boots and wrote them off as “faggots.” Beer-swillers in Boston left in droves, marooning the band onstage in the 5,000-capacity Boston Armory. Years after the Dolls’ 1975 falling-out, charismatic frontman David Johansenexplainedthe band’s highly “colloquial” sense of humor, which didn’t translate beyond “St. Mark’s and 2nd.” But punk entrepreneur Malcolm McLaren, who briefly managed the Dolls in their decline, might have summed up the group’s trainwreck charm best in a 2004 op-ed: “They were so, so bad they were brilliant.”\nBefore they were New York Dolls, the bandmates were outer-borough rogues who joined forces like the various mobs stalking pavement inThe Warriors. Queens-born guitarist Johnny Thunders was a high school baseball player who,according to him, was scouted by the Dodgers. But when the pro team demanded he lob off his nest of jagged jet hair, Thunders refused. He dabbled in delinquency, roaming the streets with a petty gang called the 90th Street Fast Boys. Ill-starred drummer Billy Murcia was a Bogotà-to-Queens transplant and Thunders’ classmate. Bassist Arthur “Killer” Kane, a soft-spoken Bronx native who towered over his bandmates, was recruited in part for his imposing look (like a “mutated Marlene Deitrich,” asone criticput it). Sylvain Sylvain, a Queens boy by way of Cairo, replaced the group’s earlier guitarist Rick Rivets, who was booted for fucking off and showing up late to practice.\nJohansen, the sole member from Staten Island, was born to a librarian mother and an opera singer-turned-insurance-salesman father. Despite this middle-class milieu, he was a puckish kid, taunting the nuns at his Catholic school, engaging in minor turf warfare by riding his bike into territorial neighborhoods, and sneaking spins of his older brother’s blues and doo-wop singles; the Diablos, Howlin’ Wolf, and Lightnin’ Hopkins were in heavy rotation. By age 17, Johansen had relocated to the East Village and was splitting his time between working at an outré clothing store on St. Mark’s Place and running the sound and lights at Charles Ludlam’sRidiculous Theatrical Company, an outpost of camp, avant-garde drama that often cast amateur actors in gender-swapped roles. The experience might have influenced Johansen’s streetwalker chic, but by his account, the Dolls were cross-dressing long before they considered forming a band."

Since its commercial high point in the mid-1990s, when you could say “I wanna fuck you like an animal” to the percussive hiss of a steam valve opening and headline the Woodstock sequel, the often-brutal, occasionally ridiculous form of machine music has mostly stayed underground. Blame it on ’90s nostalgia, or on the world’s drift toward the kind of ruinous techno-wasteland that birthed industrial in the first place, but it’s suddenly everywhere.Folk singers are wearing demon horns.Superstars are fawning over Trent Reznor, who is himself preparing for Nine Inch Nails’ first world tour in several years. The record that most fully captures the rank spirit of 2025—aya’shexed!—is a blown-out collage of panic and distorted beats forged by an artist from Manchester, a city whose fortunes rose and crashed with the Industrial Revolution so dramatically it helped to birth communism. OnYours, With Malice,Youth Codereturn after half a decade to a cultural moment primed for their throat-bleeding industrial and EBM with an EP that hammers away so relentlessly, it pounds the line between machine and human into dust.\nWhile their music has always borrowed as heavily from hardcore and metal as from the likes of Front 242 and :wumpscut:, Youth Code’s records have never been as intense and messy as they feel like they should. While that tension between snarling attitude and relatively accessible music made for compelling listening, it suddenly feels pale in the light ofYours, With Malice. The five-song EP is the first new music Sara Taylor and Ryan George have released since 2021’s King Yosef collaborationA Skeleton Key in the Doors of Depressionand their first true Youth Code record in nearly a decade. It feels like Youth Code mk2, a hard reset of their sound in which the specter of violence that’s always haunted their music comes fully alive, drenched in sweat and showered in sparks.\nTaylor’s vocals have always been the key to Youth Code’s music, and onYours, With Malice, they charge forward, in lock-step with the frying synths and programmed d-beat drums. While EBM and industrial singers can sometimes come off as the magician at the controls of the throbbing machine, her agender bark seems to come from within the machine itself, as if her veins are fused into oil lines. She commands these songs as if she’s a hardcore singer, and the music believes her. “I’ll never pretend to be something I’m not,” she spits in the chorus of opener “No Consequence,” and you can see her lashing at the crowd on each syllable. Textures clash all around her—fist-pumping drums, overheating synths, a sinister keyboard line, everything on the edge of misfiring. It’s like someone poured vinegar intoNew Order’s circuitry. She screams the bitter triumph of “In Search of Tomorrow”’s chorus like she’s flinging her convictions into an angry sky."

    "review_text": "For all theesoteric mythosand technofeudalistworld-buildingthat2hollisand his legion of devotees built around his music, the Los Angeles-based rapper,not-rapper, and producer’s 2024 record,boy, felt more like a cult coming-of-age classic than a futuristicLord of the Ringsspin-off. Released in the weeks leading up to his breakthrough stint opening onKen Carson’sChaosTour,boypeeled back the palimpsest to emphasize the sincere teenage sentimentality at the core of Hollis’ work. He cooed about awkward crushes and devastating breakups over effervescent, sugary EDM, generating a strangely tender emotional dissonance that resonated with zoomers who grew up mainliningTrap Nationuploads. Most importantly, though, the album was peppered with enough pulverizing low end to win over the mosh-happy Opium fans who’d turned out in droves for Ken’s tour. With his status as an internet rap luminary cemented, 2hollis returns to the mythmaking of his earlier discography with a new album,star. As its title suggests, the new LP explores the highs and lows of being an object of hero worship, backed by festival-ready beats that bang like post-millennial supernovae.\n“You preach, I’ll beam, they teach,” Hollis bellows on “Destroy Me,” a sweaty electro-pop workout wedged instar’s center section. He’s still writing love songs, but rather than playing the secret admirer, he’s assumed the role of reluctant cult leader. Free to indulge in his hedonistic impulses, this new Hollis is wired, paranoid, and flaming out in tragic—yet ecstatic—fashion. “Tell Me,” a name-searcher’s lament, weighs contradicting desires to be adored and ignored as layers of plucky, pugnacious bass generate tension. The thematic conflict remains unresolved, leaving Hollis “sick and awake” with visions of a crowd looking up at him in a fresh, melancholy twist on the traditional EDM build/drop structure. As misty synth pads seep in like fog machines and a mechanical kick begins to stomp, fear gives way to cathartic awe.\nLike2andboybefore it,staraims closer to pure dance-pop than Hollis’ recent singles suggest. Aside from the interlude-length “sidekick,” there’s little in the way of the skitteringragefusion of “trauma” or the glitchy swag-rappasticheof “style” here. At the same time, this new batch of floor-fillers also reins in the glittery electroclash maximalism of previous full-lengths. Cleaner textures and leaner arrangements win out onstar, which prioritizes throbbing low end over soaring melody: The first half of “flash” is comprised of little more than a chunky bassline and drums, putting greater emphasis on Hollis’ vocals. Without an armor of witch house distortion or future bass opulence, he sounds beautifully vulnerable, light echo on his voice as he sings from the perspective of the “Holli” he can be when the cameras aren’t in his face. As the track progresses, a simple chiptune arpeggio injects a strain of self-assuredness. For the remaining runtime, Hollis takes cues from a classic PC Music single, Life Sim’s “IDL,” by subjecting a single synth arp to a series of mad science experiments to see how its aura changes. The loopedbloops drag the track into new keys, ramp up the tempo, and eventually spill out of control as they’re crushed beneath a flurry of hardstyle kicks. The effect is exhilarating, as if we’re bearing witness to a magical girl-style transformation sequence fromboyintostar."

The book is a primary inspiration forCity of Clowns, Davidson’s thundering, itchy, pneumatic new record, co-produced withSoulwaxand Pierre Guerineau, her partner inEssaie Pas(who once made analbum inspired by Philip K. Dick) andL’Œil Nu. Their proto-electroclash beats and big-squelch synths evoke a swaggering heroine up against cold cement and server banks, a real-life sci-fi dystopia that’s a little bitThe Matrixand a little bitThe Substance: You’re in the system, and it’s feeding on you.\nIn the surveillance economy, you and I are neither customers nor products but “theobjectsfrom which raw materials are extracted and expropriated,” Zuboff writes (italics hers). That raw material is our data, more valuable to business than any one of us. Davidson quotes a number of Zuboff’s terms and concepts directly, including the lightly modified text of opening track “Validations Weight.” “You learn to sacrifice your freedom to collective knowledge imposed by others and for the sake of their guaranteed outcomes,” Davidson reads through the clipped enunciation of an AI text-to-speech filter. The long-range outcome of surveillance capitalist practices, Zuboff argues, is to enforce certainty and homogenization—to make us less human.\nCity of Clowns,in effect, takes place on the internet, in a world of data collection, ad targeting, and behavioral prediction. Davidson’s true feelings on supposedly cutting-edge technology are not hard to discern. (“I don’t need a VR headset to feel emotion,” she snarked onWorking Class Woman; “Reality is disgusting enough.”) Zuboff’s book, a meticulous investigation of a society where innovation has seemingly shifted entirely to the financialization of the virtual, is similarly heady in its online-ness. Transposing even some of these concepts to dance music is tough, and Davidson probably deserves the most credit for managing to make it not just danceable but actually… pretty funny?\nThough Davidson’s style is often described as deadpan,City of Clownshas a pranksterish, almost burlesque quality. “Play this game,” she invites over ultra-basic drum machine and skronked-upDepeche Modebass on “Push Me Fuckhead”: “Stare at the squares/What do you see?/How many buses?/How many trees?” You likely never explicitly agreed to train future AI platforms by solving visual CAPTCHAs like these—indeed, they’re presented as a necessary security measure. But maybe youlikefeeling exploited? On the cyborg striptease “Demolition,” tracking software gears up to dom you: “I don’t want your cash/What I want is you… I want your data!” Davidson engages with her ambivalence about the pleasure we experience online, too, pondering whether she’s secretly a “bitch,” a cooperator, ready to “offer you my heart right on a selfie stick.” And are we sure that “Y.A.A.M.”—short for “all your asses are mine”—isn’t somehow related to “All your base are belong to us,” theiconic ur-memewith its owngabber remix? (More like “all your database” amirite?)"

    "review_text": "The Elephant Man’s Boneswas a true event album—a long-rumored, highly anticipated meeting of two hip-hop legends. It delivered on the hype in surprising fashion: a minimalist opus that shivered and smoldered more than it slapped. Though it bore the stylistic markings of its creators,Roc Marcianoandthe Alchemist, the album felt distinct in their respective catalogs. Instead of mangled soul loops and hard-edged boom-bap, this was mafioso rap tuned by Tibetan singing bowls; Al provided a pineal gland-stimulating airiness through which Marci floated like the ghost of a kingpin. Two years later, after attending to their solo careers, Al and Marci return withThe Skeleton Key, a weirder, bleaker, more hermetically sealed take on prestige street rap. There’s no bloat, no guests, and no superfluous sounds. Each of its 10 songs feels like peering around a dark corner, an inescapable menace saturating every moment.\nAfter finding a collective voice withThe Elephant Man’s Bones, the pair settled into a comfortable rhythm, capitalizing on a long-simmering artistic connection. “We always making music,” Marciexplained toRolling Stone. “I’m always sitting on a batch of beats from Al.” Their near-constant workflow makesThe Skeleton Keythe product of a shared musical syntax that only comes from a deep and constant creative practice. On this leaner, meaner second record, Al’s beats are spacious yet brittle, peeling the layers from samples until only a groove remains. Marci writes with laser-cut precision, his exploded-view rhyme schemes locking together like the gears of an expensive wristwatch. When a song has a chorus, it usually bookends one long, sinister soliloquy. Everything adds up to a nearly unbreakable tension.\nIfThe Elephant Man’s Boneswas the soundtrack to a one-last-job jewelry heist,The Skeleton Keyis the white-knuckle, bullet-sweating aftermath. Alchemist excels at pinpointing the most unnerving parts of a song—a minor-key piano modulation here, a restless drum fill there—and looping them to intensify their unease: Consider the chilling, dissonant, four-chord vamp that carries “Chopstick” or the blaring horn that slices through gentle Rhodes noodling on “Street Magic.” “Chateau Josué” has an anagogic quality, as if its greasy synth line and persistent kick were part of a ritual to wake the dead. Most striking is “Cryotherapy,” a wind tunnel of moaning vocals and what sounds like a harp glissando compressed into a ghostly shriek. Drums, if present at all, often feel several rooms away. Voices are recognizably human but bent into uncanny shapes. It’s some of Al’s most spartan work, but still as colorful, psychedelic, and hair-raising as a giallo death scene."

    "review_text": "It’s been 30 years sincePortishead’sDummytook home the Mercury Prize and cemented Bristol’s trip-hop underground, but its woozy turntablism echoes across the pop spectrum today: the pitch-shifted melancholy ofSky Ferreira, the bass-heavy brooding ofa.s.o., the dreamy reverb ofcrushed. The juxtapositions and subversions that made the genre groundbreaking at its inception still have an obvious appeal. Trip-hop’s contrast of wistful vocals against steely, computerized rhythms is an easy aesthetic shorthand for nihilism, existentialism, and accelerationism. It’s theoretically perfect, in other words, for sighing deeply while reminiscing about “morphine kissing” and “acid tripping,” asyeuledoes on their fourth album,Evangelic Girl is a Gun.\nyeule has wielded nostalgia as a weapon before: 2023’ssoftscarsused the serrated edges of nu-metal and grunge to amplify their rage, and a year prior,Glitch Princessincorporated shades of mid-2000s indie folk into its complex digital circuitry. Much of yeule’s artistic output is preoccupied with dissociation and disconnection—rotting, maiming, and otherwise escaping the flesh. Their strongest songs use nostalgia to ground that disembodiment in the undeniably human: the strikingly simple strum of an acoustic guitar on “dazies,” a bloodcurdling scream on “x w x.” But onEvangelic Girl is a Gun, yeule deflates much of what created that productive tension; these songs offer disappointingly little to differentiate themselves from their already heavily referenced source material.\nIt’s not thatEvangelic Girl is a Gunis a challenging listen—the slow, shuffling rhythms and bluesy basslines on “Tequila Coma” and “What3vr” will go down easy for fans ofMobyandMassive Attack, while “VV” recalls the 2000s soft rock of Ingrid Michaelson and Natasha Bedingfield. With production from an illustrious group includingA.G. Cook,Clams Casino, andMura Masa, the album sounds technically sharp, filled with small flourishes—the click of a gun reloading on “Saiko,” the sound of a camera flash on “1967.” But it is, despite the suggestion of sex and violence in its marketing, ultimately tedious.\nAt 31 minutes,Evangelic Girl is a Gunis the shortest record yeule has released, but repetitive choices make it feel far longer. A stifling, slow-moving beat seems to carry the first two songs forward at a morphiated drip. Moments on “Eko” and “1967” that should feel climactic—repeating the song’s title as breakbeats ricochet, screaming about a lover going off to war—are lost in the background, competing against a small army of vocal filters. “Skullcrusher” is perhaps the worst offender, so numbingly loud and slow it almost sounds as if it were accidentally exported at half speed. There is no emotional anchor here like the onslaught of “dazies” onsoftscars, nor a moment of differentiation like the shocking vulnerability of “Don’t Be So Hard on Your Own Beauty” onGlitch Princess. Despite its apparent intricacies,Evangelic Girl is a Gunfeels oddly flat."

    "review_text": "The first rule of eusexua is that you never stop talking about eusexua. For months, in anticipation of her third proper album named after this newly coined word,FKA twigshas defined eusexua by example. “Eusexua is for the girls who find their true selves under a hard metal silver stiletto on the damp rave floor,” read part of the text over a blurry TikTokvideoof her eyes darting around a room. It’s the feeling of, “I’m that bitch,” according to makeup artist Joe Brooks in apromo videouploaded to YouTube. “Eusexua is a practice. Eusexua is a state of being. Eusexua is the pinnacle of human experience,” reads the title card at the end of thevideofor the album’s title track. But what does any of thatmean?\nIn aninterviewonVogue’sThe Run-Throughpodcast, twigs described eusexua as a kind of flow state in which one can lose track of time. She also revealed a tangible definition: “For me, it’s also the moment before I get a really good idea of pure clarity. Like, when everything moves out the way, everything in your mind is completely blank and your mind is elevated.” InThe Standard, shecalledeusexua “that moment of nothingness just before a big surge of inspiration or creativity or passion. I describe it as a moment before an orgasm.”\nAh, clarity. There wasn’t really a word for that referenced special moment of blankness, which carries such a thrill because 1) you know whatever is about to happen is about to happen, but 2) you have no idea how it’ll go. That oncoming orgasm could be the best orgasm of your life. Eusexua is why May is the best month of summer and why ordering and retrieving your coke is sometimes more fun than doing it. The sureness of achievement plus hope for its totality is a hell of a drug. If nothing else, “eusexua” is more useful than most made-up words in pop music—from “Californication” to “Fergilicious” to “sussudio” to “zig-a-zig-ah.”\nFor further justification, look no further than “Eusexua” the song, where atop a track-length four-on-the-floor club crescendo, twigs relates: “Words cannot describe, baby/This feeling deep inside.” Here she explicitly reaffirms her alignment with art’s imperative of expressing what previously went unexpressed. At the same time, the track’s form is familiar: On a fundamental level, the bangers onEUSEXUAbang like once and future bangers. As she flits from techno to house to garage to drum and bass, the behavior of the almighty bass remains recognizable. She’s balancing saying something new with knowing what has always worked, a Goldilocks approach to making pop. And while it would be a stretch to call twigs a pop star at this point in time (she’s never had a pop chart hit in any territory besides New Zealand), that isn’t stopping her from running circles around virtually everyone else with a legitimate claim for the title. The concept, the sound, and the look—particularly the apocalypse-in-the-front, party-in-the-back hairstyle she’s been rocking lately,inspired by ancient Egypt—all makeEUSEXUAan era for the ages."

    "review_text": "Top$ideandShaudy Kashhave fostered the type of chemistry that you usually only see between detective pairings onLaw & Order(à la Lennie Briscoe and Rey Curtis), where the beats of their relationship have played out on loop without a hitch. You’re able to set your watch to the way the Detroit pairing’s rhythms interact. The Monroe, La.-raised Top$ide sets the mood with morose, chilling funk beats—often representing a zig to the city’s pounding club production—letting Kash saunter under the radar with his conversational register and rambling rants. By the arrival of the fourth and latest installment of theirOn the Yeah Sideseries, the “feeling out” portion of Top$ide and Shaudy Kash’s partnership is decidedly in the rearview mirror.\nThroughoutOn the Yeah SideDeluxe(the follow-up to 2024’sVol. 3), the two artists focus on refining the formula they’ve cemented over the past three years. Where previous iterations felt largely insular, here, Top$ide and Shaudy Kash are set on inviting more and more Detroit voices into the fold with a slew of remixes. Some of the guests’ energies are misaligned withOn the Yeah Side Deluxe’stenor, but the pairing’s synergy remains undeniable, sometimes making you wonder why they ever stray away from each other.\nTop$ide’s serene, gloomy production almost doubles as a soothing paint-by-numbers exercise for Shaudy Kash. These beats often feel like the soundtrack to a crime movie montage, backing the moment that someone admits to doing dirt of the highest degree: take “Logic > emotions,” where Shaudy Kash muses about shooting someone because they insulted his marksmanship as a muted, groovy bassline churns in the background. In another life, “Forreal (Top$ide Mix)” would stand out in the back end of a late ’90s No Limit tape, played exclusively in seedy basements and cellars clouded with cigar smoke. Here, it allows Shaudy Kash to get wistful about stealing your girl without breaking a sweat in a comfortable environment, where you can almost see him shrugging as he admits it. But the similarities between the softer beats cause some moments to run together and fall short, especially if Shaudy Kash and others aren’t on their game. Shaudy Kash lacks some of the sharpness of his other performances on “Chameleon,” where his bars get bogged down and the lines bleed together. It feels like YBN LIL BRO spends most of his cameo on “Stuck In My Ways” doing a balancing act, trying to find the right pocket while toeing the line between tough and sensitive."

    "review_text": "Think of Texan artistsclaire rousayand Mari Maurice, akamore eaze, as a kind of social-media ageWeen: their collaborations marked by marriages of lo-fi experimentalism and pop standards, irreverent humor, and—above all—restless genre-hopping. Their first album together, 2020’sif I don’t let myself be happy now then when, explored their experiences growing up in San Antonio and coming out as trans women through a shifting morass of field recordings. Extrapolating shared interests in found sound, pitch-shifted vocals, andThird Eye Blind, they conceptualized a genre they termed “emo ambient”: typified by a song like “Smaller Pools,” from 2021’sAn Afternoon Whine, but morphing on tracks likeNever Stop Texting Mehighlight “Kyle” —with its crystalline synths and trap beats—into something closer to hyperpop.\nTheir latest collaboration,no floor, is another left turn: an instrumental record built around collaged electro-acoustic sounds that tells the story of their friendship through portraits of bars and venues—memorialized in the track titles—that they’ve visited. Combining elements of the pair’s joint and solo projects, these spacious, moving instrumentals are immediately identifiable as the work of rousay and Maurice. If you’re new to their music, this is a very pretty and distinctive ambient record, though the impressionistic style is likely to resonate most strongly with listeners who are already familiar (say, those who might be intrigued by the title’s possible relationship with “floor pt2” fromNever Stop Texting Me, or “floor pt.3” fromAn Afternoon Whine). Once you picture the pair in action,no floorbecomes a moving illustration of what it’s like for close friends to make very niche music in the vast expanse of America.\nFor the initiated, part of the joy inno flooris in identifying the two musicians’ artistic voices in conversation. In opener “Hopfields,” rousay’s brittle, ostinato guitar, which nods to last year’s albumsentiment, is joined by Maurice’s yearning pedal steel, which recalls last year’slacuna and parlor. While these songs aren’t presented as duets, “Hopfields” establishes a tender familiarity that runs through the record, even when Maurice’s violin and the pair’s joint electronics blur, as in the triumphant closing of “Lowcountry.”\nAnother mainstay of their work, found sound, takes a backseat here. rousay’s music has featured pencils, overheard conversation, and housekeys; Maurice once composed apiece“for an ensemble of amplified portal fans.” When field recordings make their way intono floor, live or synthesised sounds soon pull the focus. If those are footsteps near the top of “Kinda Tropical,” they quickly give way to ambient synths and guitar strums, while the overheard chatter that closes “Limelight, Illegally” is interrupted by a rough, synthetic lurch."

    "review_text": "Over the past few years, Oakland-based experimental electronic folk artistKathryn Mohrhas become something of a master in harnessing feelings of intense discomfort, infusing her grim synthesizer compositions with a lingering, impressionistic gloom. If 2022’sHollyEP was wispy, heavily influenced by the gauzy melancholy of its producer, Mohr’s Flenser labelmateMidwife, then her new album,Waiting Room, allows jarring dissonance to metastasize into a vivid, often graphic meditation on pain. A bone-sharp exercise in looking down the barrel,Waiting Roomconsiders what one can do in the face of abject horror: According to Mohr, stare it down. Succumb to it. As the album’s opening line puts it, “This comfort is bad for your health.”\nWritten during a creative residency at an abandoned Icelandic fish factory,Waiting Roomhas a distinctive filmic quality. One easily visualizes the isolation; field recordings of Mohr’s own explorations of the area render the atmosphere more desolate than ever. Wind howls and waves crash through layered, reverbed vocals and stark instrumentals, but analog synthesizers and natural phenomena often become frighteningly indistinguishable. The natural and the industrial collide in a way that feels uncanny, even haunted; there’s a dread in the low background whirr of factory mechanics, in the ghostly automated messaging that skips and repeats as if possessed. The spareness of the lyricism only amplifies the album’s feeling of solitude, evoking stories through oblique, terse recollections of fear and violence. Even on “Petrified,” the sweetest-sounding track, an unease seeps through Mohr’s lilting, guitar-driven melody as she coos gently about physical decay and animal torture.\nMohr’s previous work spanned spectral ambience, menacing synthesizer-and-field-recording pieces, and distorted, bass-driven melodies.Waiting Roomintegrates each kind of sound into something new, merging dark and light without diluting either element. On the album’s first single, “Driven,” she imbues wordless vocal fragments with heavy reverb, interspersing echoing gasps and whispers over a deep, eddying bassline. Atop a crackling drone on “Horizonless,” she stretches each horrific revelation so thin as to become almost unintelligible, save for a devastated whisper: “You guessed it.” ThroughoutWaiting Room, the contrast between Mohr’s sinister production and surprisingly gentle vocals bridges the eerie and the sublime, recallingGrouperby way ofMaria BC, or evenJulianna Barwick. The music feels uncomfortably clear, all-encompassing, nearly paranormal.\nOn the surface, the album is soft; on first impression, one might take it as a statement of resignation. But throughoutWaiting Roomthere’s a tension that makes the music come off fiercely aggrieved: a confrontation all the more unnerving for its quiet, ticking-time-bomb intensity. On “Take It,” the album’s melodically smoothest and vocally clearest song, Mohr’s jaded drawl belies viciousness: “A knife for carving, not for caring—yeah, what a fairytale.” On “Elevator,” another standout, she finally explodes, cranking up the blood-soaked injustices ofPJ Harvey’sIs This Desireover blown-out, rasping guitar. As she narrates the moment when someone leaves her arm trapped to be torn off by an elevator door, Mohr refuses to render the scene any less agonizing. Pleading for mercy or a chance to rewind, she forces her assailant to reckon with their own cruelty: “I know you’re looking at me,” she seethes, “you really like what you see.” Agony is no less real than the chilling vindication of bearing witness to its cause; if someone maims you, Mohr seems to say, you may as well bleed all over them."

    "review_text": "Cole Pulice’s music manifests a state of animated suspension. Over the past five years, the Oakland saxophonist and synthesist has learned to untether their instrument from the laws of physics, thanks to a fusion of real-time playing with extensive digital signal processing. They havecomparedtheir setup to being strapped into a mech suit—working their horn, or a breath-based Yamaha MIDI controller, with their mouth and hands, while both feet manipulate an array of effects pedals that stretch and warp the flow of sound. Pulice’s breakthrough recording, 2023’sIf I Don’t See You in the Future, I’ll See You in the Pasture, was a 22-minute meditation in which everything and nothing seemed to happen at once. Chords smeared outward toward the horizon, the progression so gradual you forgot where you were in the sequence, while a mercurial cadenza soared over the top. It epitomized the artist’s main organizing principle: the tension between movement and stasis.\nLand’s Endis Pulice’s first solo album since that Longform Editions release—last year they released the more lyricalPhantasy & Reality, their secondcollaborationwith ambient composerLynn Avery—and it represents a subtle but important progression in their work: While roughly half the 32-minute album builds upon the gentle amorphousness of their previous recordings, a three-part suite at the heart of the record brings electric guitar into the mix, yielding a more structured approach to songwriting.\nThe first song, “Fragments of a Slipstream Dream,” is a bridge, an extension of the gleaming arc that definesIf I Don’t See You in the Future. At the outset, Pulice methodically plays four descending notes on their horn, a staircase smeared by digital processing into a broad, frozen expanse. Blushing chords,Cocteau Twins-like in their gauzy radiance, add harmonic complexity. After a minute or so, Pulice begins playing tentative melodic figures on their horn, its timbre at first tinny and compressed, then full and breathy. There’s a searching quality to their playing, which tends to move in fits and starts, traveling outward from the center, tracing tight circles as it goes, before looping back to the starting point. Yet tracing their horn’s line of flight would be an impossible task; its movements are unpredictable, a scale model of boundlessness.\nThe mode abruptly shifts with “In a Hidden Nook Between Worlds”; the artist’s habitual fog gives way to startling clarity as Pulice plucks out a clean-tone electric guitar melody. They were new to the instrument when they recorded the piece; the Stratocaster was loaned by a friend, and they’ve described their approach as being guided by “child’s brain.” Curiously, I don’t hear anything tentative about their playing—to the contrary, it sounds unusually deliberate and composed. Though tonally steeped in Americana, the song is the most jazz-like among the artist’s work to date, saxophone and guitar moving in unison through the head of the piece before both instruments veer into abstraction in part II. Where Pulice’s previous work was clearly indebted to technologically aided improvisation and post-processing, this is the first of their pieces you could imagine being notated on the stave; the guitar imposes a sense of order that extends to Pulice’s horn."

For another,EBK Jaaybo, one of the major openers on the lineup, was arrested on gun and drug charges in Arkansas and his name was scrubbed from ticketsites. Therumor millsare now debating whether he will appear or not. Jaaybo, like YoungBoy five years ago, is a rap phenom in his early 20s who has spent too much of his life institutionalized. He makes plain-spoken, brutal Stockton drill—a grief-stricken Northern California rap scene of the 2020s, where the bleakness of the music reflects the conditions of a small city screwed over by local politicians. BesidesKendrick Lamar, he is arguably the hottest rapper in California right now, with popularity that’s as much about the vivid music as the fetish for gangsta rap authenticity.\nJaaybo’s new mixtape,Don’t Trust Me, comes on the heels of a singles run—“F*ck Everybody (Free Maxx),” “The Biggest G,” “Homebody,” none of which are on the tape—as obsessed with revenge as a Charles Bronson flick.Don’t Trust Meblows up the hushed menace of thelateYoung Slo-Beinto blunt diss records full of spookySkrilla-core choirs, hyphy drums, and bloodshed, all turned up to the speaker-crunching max. It’s visceral and bone-chilling music that makes Stockton sound like a gladiator match. “I fucked it up in the north, them niggas brunts, I could name a few victims/I told the bitch that trollin’ gang would catch up to him, he ain’t listen,” he raps on the miliant intro “Suicidal.” On the EBK posse cut “Top Rank Gz,” he says, “Embarrassed that his homie died a bitch so he didn’t post him,” with a mean flow that recalls DB tha General’s 2010s take on Bay Area mobb music.\nThere’s hardly a lyric that isn’t about death. That may seem like the norm for drill, but the way Jaaybo drags out the final syllable of nearly every line forces you to sit with the stomach-turning realities of the genre’s stories: Kids getting caught in the crossfire on “It’ll Happen to You,” an enemy pimping minors on “Exposing Me,” the casual homophobia of “Stand Over Music.” It’s not so noticeable when you listen to it one song at a time, like many will, but when you run through 21 straight tracks of neighborhood war and destruction, it feels almost as voyeuristic as watching fanmade street politics documentaries on YouTube. In fact, Jaaybo’s songs include so many name drops and searchable references that it appears as if the music is drafting off the popularity of beef content. It’s missing imagination; it’s missing style. He doesn’t haveDrakeo the Ruler’s inventive flows or YoungBoy’s hardened melodies, the stylistic elements that make those rappers’ best tapes feel like they’re not just about death, but the feeling of being surrounded by death."

    "review_text": "The first entries inLucy Gooch’s discography—a pair of five-track ambient pop EPs doused in reverb and multi-tracked glossolalia—suggested that the York, England musician was venturing deeper into the uncanny. Trading her Roland for a Prophet between the recording of 2020’sRushingand 2021’sRain’s Break, Gooch began to decorate her brief, beatless songs with more ornate synthesizer arrangements. While the former used sustained, misty drones as blank canvases for her interweaving choral arrangements, the latter felt more like a more traditional synth record, dropping plucky bass pulses and squelching arps into the chordal abyss to observe their behavior. Her emphasis on operatic vocal toplines and expressive delivery over lyrical prose have drawn comparisons to 4AD’s early catalog, particularly the entries byCocteau TwinsandThis Mortal Coil, though her preference for unearthly, artificial textures was more aligned withEno’sApollothan the Baroque tastes ofRobin GuthrieandIvo Watts-Russell.\nGooch’s first full-length album,Desert Window, inverts her trajectory, weaving earthy, organic timbres into more ambitious compositions. Most songs stretch past five minutes as the record brings live string and brass arrangements along for a surprisingly dissonant ride, encasing straightforward moments of ethereal beauty between vast expanses of understated tension. In Cocteau Twins terms, it’sThe Moon and the MelodiesmeetsTwinlights.\nThe record’s two-part epic “Night Window” exemplifies her tendency to shift between these mystical and theatrical modes. In its first moments, insectoid synth drones swarm into the soundfield, melodies breaking from the cluster but never quite resolving. Gradually Gooch’s vocals come into focus, outlining the shapes of words that barely register as language. Typically, voice acts as a catalyst for crescendo in this sort of new age-adjacent composition, soaring above the ambient backdrop. Here, it’s intentionally submerged, tinting an already hazy composition. In the second half, more acoustic instrumentation enters the fray, with struck keys and brassy bleats teasing an emotional overflow. It’s the moments leading up to catharsis, though, that Gooch is interested in highlighting: the full 10-minute suite keeps the listener at a knife’s edge, holding out for the melodic phrase that makes sense of it all. Even waiting can be a thrill, when it’s well-composed.\nOpener “Like Clay” is the biggest departure from Gooch’s earlier work, building from shimmery fingerpicked guitar into layer upon layer of interlocking takes, which loop and commune beneath a single, repeating couplet: “To wake up in morning, too long asleep/Like clay in the ground, exiled deep.” Though the words quite literally illustrate the record springing to life, they’re more like a vehicle for improvisation and experimentation. Her delivery slightly morphs with each go-around, and the surrounding harmonic ecosystem follows suit, background chirps becoming yawps as she adds a slight lilt to the end of a line. The folk trappings and ASMR-inducing field recordings on “Jack Hare” make for another fresh approach, particularly the tasteful way they decorate the song’s concluding burst of existential rumination, where Gooch mutters that “I am kiss, and I am croak, and I am wax,” and so on."

TheTV on the Radiolead singer’s debut solo album brims with portents. ButThee Black Boltz, recorded before American voters decided we needed Donald Trump breaking shit again, has little use for I-told-you-so’s: If listeners need solace now that the apocalypse is here instead of nigh, the album suggests, find it in beats and showmanship. Up to the minute, well sequenced, and straightforward in its melodic chewiness and rhythmic intentions,Thee Black BoltzcomplementsDear ScienceandDesperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes, Bush II-era canaries that have never stopped singing from their wretched coal mines.\nThee Black Boltzdoesn’t have master programmer-producer Dave Sitek on board, and on occasion I miss his thick sinister churn, but multi-instrumentalists and chief collaborator Wilder Zoby brings clarity, shaping the album around Adebimpe as a singer instead of a member of a collective. A détente exists between the bright tunes and his lyrics. IfThee Black Boltzhas a theme, it’s finding a flower in a dung heap. “Just when things got darkest/A thought said, say say…walk down and through the hillside towns,” he sings on the title track. “Sad extremes” run through his head on “Ate the Moon,” but he prays for fire, which, of course, he rhymes with “desire,” but the anxious pat-pat-pat of the percussion and the punch of Zoby’s keyboards offset the damage.\nAs weird as it might sound, Adebimpe might be looking for… hits? “Somebody New” has the thudding electronic swagger of the Weeknd’srecent work; it’s at least conceivable that Adebimpe’s sending feelers in the superstar’s direction. He pours sap all over “The Most,” in which he actually sings, “I still love you, baby,” while Zoby’s small army of synthesizers and sampled car crashes do their best to sully the sentiment. Mason Sacks’ acoustic guitar arpeggios on “ILY” flatter some of Adebimpe’s prettiest singing, a reminder to fans about his a cappellacoverofNeil Young’s “Unknown Legend” fromRachel Getting Married, a film whose undertones of pre-Obama #hopeandchange come across as quaint as a bar fight in a John Ford cowboy picture.\nAt its strongest when loopiest,Thee Black Boltzfeatures several moments when Zoby cocoons Adebimpe as the singer on a dance track, a serenader who closes his eyes and points towards the crowd with welcome camp overtones. The rattling bass on “Magnetic” serves as a platform for a ceiling-scraping performance. “Pinstack” goes for the streamlined sonics ofNine Types of Lightwhile its vocal hook summons—get this—2 Live Crew’s“One and One.” A return to the warning-from-the-pulpit mode of TV on the Radio’s “Stork & Owl,” “Blue” has the spareness of a demo, with Zoby’s Mellotron a spectral presence in a portrait of a town where “wickedness spreads like a disease.”"

    "review_text": "For this year’s Underground Rap Awards, I’m writing inJaeychino’s name for Rookie of the Year. Sure, there are Kurrco-thirsty caricatures (and genuine talents) that have put up bigger numbers, but across five tapes in 12 months, DC’s monotone auteur has refined his handiwork. In January, Jaeychino’sARTWORKtrilogy opened to pitch blackness with aremixtoNino Paid’s “Pain & Possibilities” somehow more harrowing than the original. Where Nino exorcizes grief in plainspoken spurts, Jaey lets it metastasize and fuel his appetite for reprisal. Since then, his composed drawl has made a home out of sprightly synth flourishes and maudlin vocal chops.ARTWORK II’s “Home Depot,” from June, is the kind of morning commute music that makes your gas pedal feel a little lighter. After August’s 15-track heat checkWATCH THE THRONE,Jaeychino has already resurfaced withARTWORK III,the first opus of his career.\nNearly every track scorches for less than two minutes, each corroding into the next and rarely losing momentum. The operatic detonation of “LIFE 2 REAL” is Jaeychino’s most theatrical work to date: Wailing angels buried under mammoth 808s mourn the lives he eulogizes, his ceaseless flow so urgent you picture the studio crumbling around him. The title track boxes elysian melodies in an echo chamber of drum’n’bass as Jaey uses the cracks in his voice to convey adversity (“Man who gon’ do right for the youngins?”). The track’s only blemish comes in the form of a painfully misguided Trump endorsement. But like the earnest street poets that precede him, Jaeychino weaves assertions of vengeance into a quilt of anguish, illustrating the brutal cycle in which he feels trapped. For every bar in memoriam of a loved one, there’s another around the corner beckoning death.\nJaeychino’s ear for enlivening production offsets what spills from his memory bank. It’s hard to hear his precise deadpan over producer SJR’s caustic beats and notthinkofclassicLucki; the ghastly haze of “RPS” recallsWatch My Back-era gloom.ARTWORK IIIpropels the comatose wisp of this sound with symphonic polish and post-Opium vitriol. The pindrops of piano that add delicacy to “AND1” and “30” make the calamity of centerpiece “FAKE PS” feel monumental: As metal clangs violently, DMV compatriot ST6 JodyBoof drops in to toss grenades in the street. “I’m ridin’ with Jaey, I know we gon’ blow,” he erupts, “Black truck with ’em shooters, I feel like the pope.” This track’s industrial churn runs through the entire tape, surging into “PR4Y” and the cracklingSnow Stripperscollab “STURDY.” “TRIS” takes on an incandescent sheen that resemblesTibetan bowl rituals; its warmth emanates like sunrays through a screen door. Rarely across the tape’s half-hour runtime does time feel wasted."

That might sound like an odd thing to say of a band whosemost recent albumis a nearly three-hour, 40-track compilation of acoustic covers of their own back catalog, but the impulse to stun, bewilder, and confound has been an animating motivation since their formation in Dublin in the mid-1970s. It’s what excited the thunderous political ardor ofWarin 1983; what inspired their shift toward expressive watercolor grandeur onThe Unforgettable Fire; what drove them to “go away and dream it all up again” after the landmark success ofThe Joshua Treecaused drummer Larry Mullen Jr., to worry that the band was “turning into the world’s most expensive jukebox.” Fear of being boring might be U2’s defining feature. And it is the essence ofPop.\n“I do think that we live right now at a time, the fag end of the 20th century, where there’s a lot of nostalgia, and the musical climate is like karaoke,” Bono muses, voice even and eyes searching, halfway throughU2: A Year in Pop, a 45-minute prime-time special that aired on ABC in the spring of 1997. “People aren’t liking things because theyaregreat. They’re liking them because they remind people of something that was great.”\nIt was a complaint that Bono sounded often around the release ofPop, U2’s ninth studio album and—depending on what kind of U2 fan you ask—either their most interesting, most challenging, or least successful. In the wake of U2’ssurprising reinvention as one of the most consequential popular rock bands of the 1990s, Bono had become enthralled by the pursuit of a freshly contemporary sound, and he had been pursuing it everywhere: in hip-hop and disco, techno and R&B. “When we’re at my house,” he told a reporter at the time, “it’s Sonic Youth next to Chic, into Dr. Dre or Wu-Tang Clan, into ‘Surf’s Up’ by the Beach Boys. Now, that might be a fucked up evening for some people, but that’s the way I live.”\nPractically the only thing he wasn’t interested in listening to anymore was rock—it had become too stagnant, too resistant to change. “Y’know, what is rock music now? What is it?” he asked rhetorically inQmagazine. “Because there was once a time when people hadn’t heard the sound of an electric guitar overloading through a little printed circuit going into an amp. When people heard Hendrix, that was fresh.” You wouldn’t find that pioneering spirit listening toR.E.M.orOasis, Bono felt. You had to look further afield. As he toldTime, “White-bread rock has, for me, lost its sense of adventure, and seems very tired in comparison to hip-hop.”"

The tony Upper East Side cabaret lounge is not the natural habitat for an indie-rock veteran—this joint has a dress code (jackets mandatory for gentlemen) and a $95 two-course menu—but it fits with a certain borrowed elegance that has characterized the singer’s work outsidethe Walkmen. On his first solo album, 2014’s excellentBlack Hours, he dallied with late-night strings and marimba, crooning like aSinatraacolyte in 1961. His2016 follow-up, a collaboration withRostam, flirted withflamenco guitaranddoo-wop throwbacks, while 2020’sThe Loves of Your Lifegot mileage out of a pleasantly ageless folk-rock sound.\nI wonder, though, what the well-heeled Carlyle clientele will make ofThis Side of the Island, which injects some welcome grit and aggression into Leithauser’s sound. It’s the first solo record he’s completed since a triumphant Walkmen reunion tour in 2023, and though he’d already begun work on the record at his home studio in Brooklyn, some of that pent-up energy seems to have settled here. Leithauser comes out swinging on “Fist of Flowers,” a song that had been percolating for more than eight years but didn’t feel complete until he brought in backing vocalists for a rollicking “doot-doo” refrain. The pounding rocker “Knockin’ Heart,” one of seven songs completed with the help ofAaron Dessnerat his upstate studio, roils and shakes like aYou & Meouttake, with Leithauser deploying big hooks and grand promises: “There’s no one who’s gonna need you like I do tonight,” he yowls.\nThe album suggests a loose beachside theme—songs called “Burn the Boats” and “Off the Beach”; Leithauser barefoot in a Hawaiian shirt on the back cover—but not in a restful vacation way, more in an ogling-the-waves-in-a-debaucherous-haze-while-your-life-crumbles way. Anarchic saxophone skitters around the edges of “Ocean Roar,” an off-center ballad memorializing the lateRichard Swift, with whom Leithauser is wandering Wilshire Boulevard, lighting up cigars, as the song opens. Those good times are over; a later verse obliquely hints at Swift’s decline: “He used to stress the audience/Now he don’t care what we think.” Dessner’s fingerprints are most palpable on the kitchen-sink production of “Burn the Boats,” which pairs Leithauser’s lovesick ramblings with a big, hulking R&B groove. With a four-on-the-floor beat and backing singers who sound like they got the night off fromSteely Dan’s Beacon residency, the track feels like it should collapse under its own weight but never does."

For simplicity’s sake, it’s best to split emo into two halves representing key influences on the genre: punk and indie rock. (Don’t make me tapthe sign.) Vancouver quartetwater marginis a clear-cut example of a band born from the former, and their official introduction,Gleaming Cursed, leaves no room for mistaking their suave evolution from that starting point. An astonishingly self-assured debut, it builds off the emo and post-hardcore of 1990s forebearers without resorting to filler or redundancies.\nAfter growing up on a steady diet ofDrive Like Jehu,Fugazi, andUnwound, water margin’s members—singer-guitarists Geordon Gaskill-Cadwallader and Jean-Michel Lacombe, bassist Arman Paxad, and drummer Patrick Williams—looked beyond those bands’ cultivated mystique to instead learn their distinct language: thick, rolling bass tone pushed up in the mix; guitars that jab at each other like fencers; drum patterns that shift downbeat placements and smooth drumrolls into one trilling whole note. In repeating it back, however, water margin don’t crib from their heroes or namecheck for clout. Instead, their songwriting and stylistic flair is naturally in conversation with the past. Take the extended breakdown of “Cryptogoth,” where they so carefully reintroduce instruments, one caustic guitar riff and flailing drum fill at a time, that the single could easily be mistaken for a lost Jade Tree 7” that Numero Group would scramble to reissue.\nAcross nine songs, water margin invoke hallmarks of the genre’s underground scene: the muscular guitar melody of “Plague Runner” is so John Reis-coded that Spotify algorithms could mistake it forHot Snakes; the stilted pauses in “Tiger Ward” recallthe Van Pelt’s looming moods; both “Palisades” and “Shy of Merit” ebb in tempo like the cautious moments of heftierJets to BrazilorJawboxsongs. Even better, two of water margin’s most prominent influences are fellow Canadians: Their unremitting bass lines evoke those by the short-lived and underrated Ottawa post-hardcore ’90s trioShotmaker, and their ambitious punk hollering could fit onOuter Heavenby the defunct 2010s Toronto greatsGreys. It’s as if water margin burned their own emo greatest-hits CD in 1999, let the blazing sun melt it on the seat of their Chevy Corsica, and swirled a distilled version of that liquid plastic into nine original songs made of sleek tungsten."

    "review_text": "Dan Bejar is a master of apocalyptic absurdity. In his work, unbearable heat isparrot weather. The Renaissance painter Tintoretto becomes shorthand for being dumb. “Crimson Tide” might be a reference to the Alabama football team and to blood and how it drips out of your body. As Bejar explains it, a crimson tide is also a lazy river, a vulture eating off the floor, “a circus mongrel sniffing for clues.” Over the past three decades, Bejar has built up a whole register of these images. He has created his own syntax and grammar. When he sings about television supervisors, Chinatowns in unremarkable cities, and a Ferris wheel on the run from the snow, all of it is ruthlessly in conversation with itself. His 14th record,Dan’s Boogie,is no outlier. It builds on this language and, like allDestroyerrecords, is a character study. The character being studied is once again Bejar himself.\nOnDan’s Boogie,Bejar is a nightlife impresario. He is sitting in the green room in a velvet suit. He’s jetting off to Bologna for a long weekend. He is telling you that he wasn’t put on the Earth toargue with you.He is taking a puff from a cigar and reminding you thatwomen fill out and men crumble inwards.If 2022’sLabyrinthitiswas a record of all-night amphetamine disco,Dan’s Boogieis what you would listen to the next morning in your sunglasses on the train or drinking a vodka in the bathtub. The production is less manic, no four on the floor, no spontaneous drum machine bubble. Instead it is a record of complete control, full string arrangements, live jazz piano glissandos. Tasteful guitar squawk. Like a big sigh. A simultaneous “sunrise/sunset,” as he sings on the title track while synths pirouette and horns glitter in the background.\nAnd all of it is familiar territory. The reference point for this record is not a specific époque of music or a lofty concept. The reference point is other Destroyer records, “aPoison Season/Your Bluesmash-up,” according toBejar himself.Dan’s Boogieis not a facsimile of its predecessors. It is funnier, wiser, though the stakes are perhaps a little lower. Look no further than “Sun Meet Snow.” Bejar is in the zone, free associating over horns, over imperial piano runs, a cymbal crash. It sounds live, like you’re there with him in the hotel bar. “I’m into it,” he says, winking, “Ifyou’reinto it.” It all feels effortless, like he’s been doing this for his whole life, which he basically has."

    "review_text": "In “Irreversible Damage,” the emotional centerpiece ofthe Weather Station’s seventh album,Humanhood, we hear a moving conversation between songwriter and bandleader Tamara Lindeman and a friend. “When you get shattered into a million pieces,” the friend asks over warping synth chords and a meandering saxophone melody, “what can you do?” Can you put the pieces back together? How do you try? The conversation— mixed so that the human voices are not above or in front of their instrumental companions but woven among them—concerns personal heartache and environmental catastrophe both. The conversation, like much ofHumanhood, doesn’t definitively answer the questions it poses; instead, it stares at that shattering directly, considering equally the destruction it caused and the potential to rebuild.\nThe Weather Station has been releasing emotionally attuned, patiently beautiful music for over a decade. But 2021’sIgnorancerepresented a breakthrough, a stunning record where Lindeman’s early folksy singer-songwriter sound blossomed with a full band: bass, keys, and guitar, plus two drummers, a saxophonist, and a flutist. Much of that record centered on the climate crisis, and Lindeman’s personal mourning at its unfolding—how the loss of species and the destruction of ecosystems is not just a political or structural failure, but also can truly break a person’s heart. Its follow-up,How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars, was looser and more intimate, a quieter companion toIgnorance’s audaciousness.\nForHumanhood,Lindeman regrouped withIgnorance’s rhythm section, plus two additional musicians on woodwinds and bass, and spent two sessions improvising at Canterbury Music Company in Toronto. These recordings were later overdubbed with banjo, fiddle, guitar, strings, synth, and percussion. The group effort rendersHumanhood’s songs lush and circuitous, seemingly propelled by an internal logic that’s being pieced together as you hear it. Many songs, including the jazzy “Mirror” or the aching “Ribbon,” feature extended, wordless outros where instruments drift in and out. Elsewhere, abstract instrumental tracks—“Descent,” “Passage,” “Aurora”—seem to offer a chance to breathe; still, the soundscapes created by their wallops of static and creeping crescendos hardly let the album’s tangled tensions evaporate.\nLindeman’s exquisite voice is, as ever, the gravitational center of the record. In certain moments—as on “Sewing” or “Lonely”—her singing can turn conversational, or become light as a whisper. Her voice feels close to your ear and, if you listen closely, you can hear a note of strain, like she’s divulging something she’s not quite ready to share. Lindeman comes by this fractured, anxious perspective honestly—many of these songs were written about her experience with chronic depersonalization that followed the release ofIgnorance. “My mind glitching, kinda/Thinking dark thoughts lately,” she sings onHumanhood’s title track, “I should admit to somebody/Feeling cut off lately.” She asks herself: “Was I a person?”"

    "review_text": "Clara La San isn’t one to capitalize on virality. The British artist’s first brush with fame occurred over a decade ago, when her spacey slow jam “Let You Go” found underground success on SoundCloud. Still in college, La San quickly drew industry attention for her wispy take on bedroom R&B. But she didn’t sign to a label, preferring to linger in her insular corner of the internet. So in 2017, when the reclusive singer dropped the mixtapeGood Mourningin collaboration with rising dance producer Jam City, it seemed like she had changed course and started aiming for the spotlight. But then, those aspirations apparently sputtered out: La San pulled the mixtape off streaming platforms two years later and retreated into hibernation.\nFor longtime fans, it was unclear ifGood Mourning’sdisappearance meant an early retirement. Stans shared bootleg copies of the project on Reddit and YouTube and built a cult following off the traces La San left online. Apart from the occasional vocal spot, La San stayed quiet—but she never completely slid into obscurity. “In This Darkness,” a longing song from her early SoundCloud days, became increasingly popular on TikTok, soundtracking everything from celebrity breakups to anime fight scenes. When La San re-emerged, it was with a debut album many years in the making:Made Mistakes,which came out in June 2024 with a foggy palette of early-’00s R&B and UK garage that elevated her laidback origins without shedding her DIY charm. I expected La San to gradually drift into the ether after that release—but instead, as if playing into her mystique, she made another unpredictable move: re-releasingGood Mourningon her own terms.\nLa San cited her perfectionist tendencies as the reason she initially pulledGood Mourning. “There was something that just didn't really feel ready [about it],” she toldThe Fader. “I can be a bit of a people pleaser but when it comes to music, if I don't like it, everyone's going to know about it.” The reworked vision ofGood Mourningisn’t a huge departure from the original recordings, but it has a more polished touch. Her new vocals are crisper, moving away from the muffled sound of the earlier version. Geoff Swan, who’s worked with pop heavyweights likeCharli XCXandChappell Roan, mixed the project and lent his hand to its more dynamic quality. Although its initial release predates our current onslaught of Y2K nostalgia, the mixtape draws from the same set of influences—Aaliyah, Timbaland, Janet—meshed with the softer edges of UK electronica. It’s a fuzzier counterpart to Erika de Casier’stake on the MTV age, relying on lush synth pads and lo-fi filters to create its hazy atmosphere."

    "review_text": "In May 1970,Chrissie Hynde, who then went by Chris, was an 18-year-old student at Kent State University who believed the Vietnam War was an untenable moral abomination. The state of Ohio could run conservative, but Kent State was a hotbed of subversive art and revolutionary mobilization. The Students for a Democratic Society had staged controversial on-campus actions in ’1968 and ’69, and in the days after Nixon announced his invasion of Cambodia, someone— presumably protestors—set fire to the college ROTC.\nThis turned out to be a terrible idea. Following a confrontation between police and local protesters, the Ohio governor called in the National Guard, also composed almost entirely of twentysomethings, who were not trained in how to keep over a thousand hippies from running roughshod over their own campus. When the protestors kept coming, the National Guard unleashed teargas canisters, creating a stampede. As Hynde recollects in her 2015 memoirReckless: My Life as a Pretender,“It was a no-win situation. If you fell over, you’d be trampled underfoot.”\nThe next day, things got worse. Protesters screamed epithets and threw rocks. Some Guardsmen got spooked and fired on the crowd. Chris Hynde was protesting on the other side of campus, so it wasn’t until shortly after that she learned her friend’s boyfriend, Jeff Miller, was one of the four dead that day outside Prentice Hall. All over America, for the previous several years, the fabric of the nation had been fraying, but here was something different: white college kids, thought to be a protected class, slaughtered on their own middle-American campus. Hynde described the pathetic confusion of the immediate aftermath of the shootings: “The Guardsmen themselves looked stunned. They were still surrounding the burned-down building. What had they been guarding? There was nothing to protect; the ROTC building was gone now. …We looked at them and they looked at us… There was a sense of incomprehension.”\nUp to this point, Hynde had been a rebel, a troublemaker, and a party girl, suspicious of authority and attracted to notions of social justice that had the added benefit of annoying her straitlaced parents. Now she was a radical, the kind of person who would one day offer the following testimony in her greatest song: “Well, I’ll die as I stand here today/Knowing that deep in my heart/They’ll fall to ruin one day/For making us part.”\nWhat kind of radical Hynde became is a complicated question—indeed, the enigmatic fulcrum of her remarkable American life. After Kent State,Neil Youngwould write the incendiary “Ohio,” an elegy but also a warning: “Tin soldiers and Nixon’s coming/We’re finally on our own.” It was the best song written about Ohio in the ’70s. Hynde, desperately trying to shrug off the trauma of the shootings, allowed in her frequently beautiful but emotionally circumscribed memoir that Young’s song “made us feel better.” Fourteen years after the massacre, she would write the best song about Ohio in the ’80s."

    "review_text": "Few figures in Detroit’s rap landscape have remained as consistent throughout the ebbs and flows of the genre’s evolution asBlack MilkandFat Ray, epitomizing the brand of resiliency endemic to that lower right quadrant of The Mitten. Their respective journeys are practices in patience, with their 2008 collaborationThe Set Upas an inflection point: Milk made his bones crafting soulful, tender boom-bap beats for the likes ofSlum VillageandElzhiin the early 2000s, before forging an adventurous path in the post-J Dillaworld with his solo projects marked by a fusion of jazz and funk production. Fat Ray moved through the city’s proving-ground clubs with a booming register and shrewd wordplay, grinding in independent circles before finding a supportive environment inDanny Brown’s Bruiser Brigade. Their latest full-length link-up,Food From the Gods,conjures up images of two weary travelers trading secrets and stories in the corner of a dark tavern, insulated from the cold and bustle in their own sphere of comfort.\nOnFood From the Gods,Fat Ray and Milk don’t hide their urge to cement themselves as guiding lights from the city’s elder generation: “Real D-Boy, know we got to protect the game/Peep the game, broke it down for you, let you keep the change,” Fat Ray spits on “Talcum.” The record is a brisk exhibition that backs up that claim, the result of a partnership that’s only gotten stronger over time. The duo is in lockstep: romping through a dark, foreboding landscape of Milk’s creation, propelling each other forward with a reliable, genuine chemistry.\nOn the surface, Fat Ray’s voice and his writing feel incongruous. His baritone growls almost mask the nimble precision of his wordplay, making the minute feel massive with every syllable. The evocations of graveyards, frigid January nights, and being tied to the bed fromMiseryturn “ELDERBERRY” into a macabre block spin. He bounces from stunting his pink gator-skin shoes, melting Klondike bars with his breath, to breaking down wealth disparities on “EL HONGO (The Mushroom),” where it almost feels as though he’s rapping to inches away from your nose. It doesn’t hurt that Fat Ray can be deathly funny. At times, this manifests in goofy snafus that that trip up the momentum—the Ice Spice-inspired “you think you the shit” line on the laidback “STASH” is akin to the rapper stepping on a cartoon rake—but more often than not, his humor imbuesFood From the Godswith personality and keeps the record from becoming self-serious."

    "review_text": "Rachel Chinouriridelights in the art of the gab. The 26-year-old British Zimbabwean pop upstart knows that sometimes the joy of falling in love comes second to the joy of regaling your friends with all the juicy details, and she’s more than eager to share. On “Can we talk about Isaac?”, the lead single and opening track from her zippyLittle HouseEP, Chinouriri recounts a chance first meeting with her now-boyfriend (yes, that’s his real name) with diaristic vividness: “He had a little black coat, 6'1\" and a cute smile/With two pints in his hands.” But rather than linger in the first blush of romance, “Isaac”’s ebullient, more-pop-than-punk chorus leaps right ahead to the de facto next step in any rom-com worth its salt. “You’ve got me spun/In radio silence,” Chinouriri sings. “And now I gotta call somebody to tell somebody ’bout you.” The song and its accompanying release are refreshing spots of brightness in a career that’s weathered a slew of recent setbacks.\nLast month, Chinouriri spoketoRolling Stoneabout the severe depression she’d experienced while working on her debut album, 2024’sWhat a Devastating Turn of Events: “I was in such a mentally terrible place. I’d ripped out so much of my hair that I had clip-ins for that tiny little piece of hair at the back.”Devastating Turnlanded the singer her first streaming hits, but she was forced to pull out of a slot opening forRemi Wolfon tour for fear it would leave her in debt.Little House, mercifully, was written from a sunnier vantage point, with Chinouriri basking in the glow of a new relationship and a run of shows supporting pop crown princessSabrina Carpenter. On “23:42,” infatuation sounds like a Gary Glitter stomp and some “lalala”s straight out of peak-eraPassion Pit. At the center of it all is Chinouriri’s voice, a versatile, resilient instrument that can stand up to such jam-packed arrangements by flipping from soft and suppliant to brash and feisty on a dime.\nChinouriri still gets tangled in an unwieldy metaphor from time to time. The “23:42” couplet “If I’m prepared to throw the peach/And have you catch it so I never have to bruise” is a bit hackneyed, as is the extended Biblical framing on “Judas (Demo),” which leads the EP’s stripped-down and melancholic second half. The track’s half-muffled acoustic guitar seems destined to land it on playlists alongsidePhoebe Bridgerscome “sad girl autumn.” And while it doesn’t quite measure up to the best ofPunisher’s writing, a line like “Passed the line of ‘We can't do this’/Dandelion, I think I blew it,” strikes the perfect balance of wit and breath-catching sorrow. The best parts ofLittle Housenever take themselves too seriously, pulling tricks from the classic pop songbook—like the chatty backing vocals on “Can We Talk About Isaac?” or “Indigo”’s perpetually unfinished hook: “You make love feel like…”\nLike a friend who’s easy to confide in because she lays out her own mess first, Chinouriri’s greatest asset is her accessibility. She handwrites responses to fan mail, is what might be described as a “chronicposter,” and peppers her discography with genuinely intimate disclosures—see the “Isaac” single’s grainy, haphazard cover art, or the lines of “Judas” where she sounds to be genuinely on the verge of tears. Her approach is a far cry from the carefully curated, post-Swiftian scavenger hunt. “If you wanted my attention,” Chinouriri sings on “23:42,” “I’m all in, no hesitation.” Perhaps that kind of raw honesty comes with its own risks: What happens if you break up with the guy whose name appears in one of your songs 11 times? I certainly wouldn’t blame Chinouriri if “Can We Talk About Isaac?” disappeared from her live setlists one day, never to return. Then again, try worrying about any of that as the song’s climactic guitar solo carries into its final chorus.Little Houseis for those of us who’ve worried enough, and are finally ready to leap without looking."

    "review_text": "Another critic turned down this assignment because they just can’t stand him, but alas,Father John Mistyis my own Roman Empire, crowding my thoughts with the music of civilization’s hubristic decline. And not a moment too soon: Josh Tillman’s sixth album under this moniker is a set of apocalyptic rockers where Jesus has gone AWOL and all the screws are coming loose. The mood swings are wilder, the logic more tangential; the songwriting might be the best it’s ever been. It’s calledMahashmashana,an anglicization of mahāśmaśāna, the Sanskrit word for cremation ground: the burning wasteland before the next life. Even playing the spiritual tourist, Misty’s compelled to point out we’re all headed to the same place.\nThe concept is an extension of 2022’sChloë and the Next 20th Century, which closed with a turning karmic wheel and the command to “build your burial grounds on our burial grounds.” In any case he’s in his groove: The album is loosely divided between two familiar modes of FJM, the wild-eyed mid-to-uptempo numbers and the melodramatic ballads of despair. The main development is that this iteration of the narrator is well aware that if he’s not out of his mind, everyone else must be. “I publicly/Was treating acid with anxiety,” he sings at one point, deadpan. He deconstructs “Amazing Grace” (“What was found is lost”) and updates “Howl” for a cultural economy of Thiel-funded sellouts: “The great-ish minds of my generation/Gladly conscripted in the war.” The world is corrupted and the line between truth and fiction is thin as the one between this realm and the next. “A perfect lie can live forever,” he proclaims.\nThe scene’s bleak but it sounds fantastic—luxe, over the top. The title track oozes sax and Old Hollywood strings. “Josh Tillman and the Accidental Dose” is soft rock for end times. All the best songs stretch toward seven minutes and beyond. A toast to decadent culture! The evident pleasure in the construction and writing of these songs is strong enough to justify lingering on this side of the veil. God forbid we have some fun with it, or rock out on “She Cleans Up,” the flatulent cowbell bruiser that dreams of opening onthe Black Keys’ tour (hahaha—but doesn’t it make you feel a little mechanical bull-curious?). You want to dare him to start choogling, and then at the end of “I Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All,” he does. You might trace certain songs to past entries in the FJM catalog: “Time” for fans ofPure Comedy’s discursive social critique, “Accidental Dose” for those charmed byI Love You Honeybear’s arch self-mythology, a moment in “Summer’s Gone” that referencesFear Fun. I get to call it a “career-spanning album”; he watches his life flash in front of his eyes."

    "review_text": "Some writers put too much stock in the Great Opening Line.S.G. Goodmanhas a couple of those, but more often, the Kentucky artist’s best moments happen in the middle. Goodman is a structuralist at heart; all of her balancing beams connect in the center of the song, and it’s there we find out—not at the beginning, or even at the end—what this thing is all about.\nIn Goodman’s music, there is always a new way to understand where you come from. For her, that place is Hickman, Kentucky—a town steeped in the scent of redtops and tobacco fields, where gas station attendants still pump your gas, and families attend church no fewer than three times a week. It’s a place Goodman conjures up with tactile clarity on her third album,Planting by the Signs. Each song is drowsy with heat. Goodman’s voice, once climbing into yelps, now sits chesty and grounded, its depth evoking earlyLucinda Williamsfiltered throughCat Power’sMoon Pix. She sings with a little tremolo so that God can hear her better, and delivers her lyrics with the charm and ease of someone showing you around their home while tea whistles on the stove.\nGoodman finds her own perspectives and idiosyncrasies in tradition. Drawing from a roots-rock sound, the drums stomp and clap with a crunch. The baritone on “Nature’s Child” sounds soaked in whiskey. The burnished tones of her keyboard pads drift lazily across “Heat Lightning” like cigarette butts floating down the Mississippi. All across the album, Goodman showcases a great understanding of space and how to fill it. Where she puts busier, low-end percussion in the bottom of the mix, as on “Satellite,” she makes sure her arrangements are sparse on the surface, her vocals and guitar gliding softly.\nGoodman also knows where balance isn’t necessary. She is so imaginative with words that you don’t mind when her lyrics topple the syllabic weight of the line. She could have rewritten the standout lyric of “Fire Sign,” “living like the sun don’t shine/on the same dog’s ass everyday,” with an eye toward metrical concision, but why would she? It’s too good; a proverb for the ages.\nLike the best artists from the South, Goodman renounces perfect symmetry and leans instead toward the crooked and out-of-focus. These are qualities embodied by the characters who populate her songs: mamas working for measly dollars. Girls unable to escape their small towns. A dying dog on his way to heaven. Her view downcast, Goodman takes on the role of omniscient narrator, threading her characters’ strange particulars and stray observations into a web of connectivity. As Goodman sings on “I Can See the Devil,” each of them live “under the same sunshine” that made the potlikker grow."

    "review_text": "Sam Wilkeswasn’t happy with “The Fool on the Hill.” The bassist had played the song—one of his favorites—at a gig dedicated to Beatles covers. It didn’t go well. Wilkes decided to try again, this time recruiting longtime friendsGregory UhlmannandJosh Johnsonto his cause. The three had never played together as a group, but they booked a concert at L.A. jazz club ETA and trusted fate and chemistry. They started the show with McCartney’s song: Uhlmann’s guitar picking out a path forward, Wilkes’ bass finding its languid way alongside, and Johnson’s sax providing the famous melody. The familiarity of the tune gave them a gentle push, but after two minutes, they were borne along by their own momentum, serenely drifting.\nThe three musicians had good reason to think they would jell. Uhlmann and Johnson found one another as teenagers in Chicago before formingSML; Wilkes and Uhlmann collaborated on an album byMiya Folick; Johnson and Wilkes were session musicians in the Louis Cole Big Band. This type of cross-pollination defines the L.A. jazz scene that has formed aroundTortoiseguitaristJeff Parker, whose long-running weekly residency at ETA spurred a resurgence in small-group improvisation across the city. Parker’s influence with this trio runs even deeper; he was a music teacher to both Uhlmann and Johnson in their early days (a fact they didn’t realize until years later). In retrospect, it seems inevitable that Uhlmann, Johnson, and Wilkes would come together—by the time they set foot on the ETA stage, they had seen one another play enough to anticipate each other’s every movement.\nGiven their pedigree and the location of their album’s recording—two concerts at ETA, one session at Uhlmann’s house—comparisons with Parker’s lauded ETA IVtet are unavoidable. If Parker’s group deals in surefooted 20-minute excursions, Uhlmann Johnson Wilkes venture out on quick scouting missions, testing the terrain in two- and three-minute jaunts. They incorporate what they call “landing zones,” pre-written material contributed by each member, as safe havens from which to launch again. The biggest difference is the lack of percussion, but on tracks like “Marvis,” from Johnson’s solo albumUnusual Object, the trio is so adept at crafting complex polyrhythms with staccato picking, short sax bursts, and muted bass thumping that it’s difficult to miss. These busy sections alternate with ambient cooldowns, sometimes within the same song—the frenetic interplay of “Hoe Down” slows to a stutter, then stops, to be replaced by an enchanting if disjointed static lull."

    "review_text": "Midway through their ambitious 2021 debut,For the First Time,Black Country, New Roadjokingly called themselves “the world's second-bestSlinttribute act.” Between frontman Isaac Wood’s agitated sprechgesang and the group’s queasy, off-center grooves, the self-inflicted burn made sense—and could have applied to a whole wave of nervy, British post-punk upstartswho talked more than they sangand attracted critical adoration around the turn of the decade.\nSince then, things changed fast, even by the mercurial currents of UK rock scenes.Fontaines D.C.rose to arena status.Shamepivoted to a more melodic sound.black midisplit. But no peer has transformed more dramatically than BC,NR. Wood stopped muttering and started singing, bringing a stately grandiosity to 2022’sAnts From Up There—thendeparted the groupbefore the album was even released. His bandmates chose to retain the name but not the songbook, sharing vocal duties and hurriedly composing new material in time for summer festival dates that they had thought would be in support ofAnts.\nIf most bands release live albums as a stopgap release (or, less generously, a cash-in), 2023’sLive at Bush Hallwas something else: a document of a band reborn. Its songs were jubilant (“Up Song”), tender (“Turbines/Pigs”), democratic—and, in a rare move for a band today, without studio equivalents. In typical fashion, Black Country are already distancing themselves from that era. “I just didn’t want to hang out with those songs anymore,” Tyler Hyde, bassist and one of three vocalists,toldRolling Stone UK.\nNow, three years after Wood’s departure, comes the studio debut of this new incarnation. And Slint, frankly, is not one of the first 2,000 reference points that come to mind. Folky and pastoral, with recorder solos and mandolin excursions and proggy journeys-in-song,Forever Howlongis as ambitious as anything this band has done. But the album radiates a deep warmth, a communal spirit that courses through the harmonies and stylistic shifts, one that has sustained this six-piece through years of upheaval and reinvention. This is music with an unabashedly twee heart, overflowing with baroque instrumentation and melody—the very things a sardonic post-punk group might regard with suspicion.\nWith saxophonist Lewis Evanschoosing to step awayfrom the mic, vocal and lyric duties are now shared between three women. Violinist Georgia Ellery, also ofJockstrapfame, has the most expressive voice and buoyant pop hooks. Her “Besties,” which kicks off the album in a burst of technicolor harmonies, seems like a straightforward paean to female friendship before revealing a layer of unrequited queer yearning: “I know I want something more,” the narrator cryptically concedes, complicating the song’s cheery façade. Ellery’s writing is dynamic enough to bridge far-flung centuries together: Who the hell mentions TikTok in a song that opens with a Baroque-sounding harpsichord overture? Similarly, what sort of medieval traveler gets betrayed by a man who looks “just like James Dean,” as does the poor heroine of Ellery’s “Two Horses,” a slow, winding narrative whose violent denouement ought to come with a warning label for equestrian lovers?"

    "review_text": "“Seeds,” the first song onLonnie Holley’s seventh album, is a harrowing, nine-minute account of his childhood incarceration at the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, a notoriously brutal institution where he experienced whippings, beatings, starvation, and other forms of torture. His narration is soundtracked by swooping strings, a tensely bouncing beat, and what sound like distorted voices rising out of the past. Those emotional and physical traumas still weigh on Holley a lifetime later, leading him to admit late in the song: “Oh, I wish I could rob my memory. I’d be like Midas and turn my thoughts to gold.” And who could blame him for wanting to lay his burden down? Forgetting, however, would be worse than living with those memories. Holley remembers so that others might not have to experience such hardships, which means there is some hope embedded in his songs. “I understand the responsibility to the truth we bear,” he says as the song fades out.\nThose are powerful words in 2025, when so many of us can hardly bear to check the news and so many others have endorsed the systemic diminishment of the accomplishments of Black Americans likeJackie RobinsonandMarsha P. Johnson. As both a sculptor and a recording artist, Holley has made remembering the great motivator of his art. He has fashioned visual art and music about his time at the Alabama Industrial School, about the tales of slavery and Jim Crow prejudice he heard from his elders, about the everyday indignities faced by Black communities in America. But he also makes art about the joys felt by those communities, about the songs that gave him strength and courage, about celebration as well as commiseration.\nSequenced at the beginning ofTonky, “Seeds” serves as an overture of exorcism: Holley acknowledges that troubling, needling memory so that he can get beyond it and make music. He’s most interested in what comes after remembering, in the ideas and actions that those memories inspire. “Protest with Love” is a joyous exhortation to take to the streets with love in your heart and with love as your weapon. Over a shuffling beat and celebratory horns, Holley sings ecstatically, reaching up into his upper register during the gospel chorus and—perhaps unintentionally—taking a line fromRihanna(“We found love!” he declares, and maybe you’re meant to imply “in a hopeless place”). For Holley, it’s not merely the most ethical form of protest, but an effective one that seeks to embrace rather than conquer."

    "review_text": "Time always seemed to be on Martin Phillipps’ mind. The singer-songwriter and leader of New Zealand bandthe Chillsinstilled his songs with looks back, roads ahead, and faded melodies that felt worn by yesterday and anxious about tomorrow. Even when he sang a simple love song, Phillipps swirled together past, present, and future in thoughtful phrases and bittersweet hooks.\nOn the final Chills album,Spring Board: The Early Unrecorded Songs,time looms especially large. Phillipps wrote these 20 tunes back in the 1980s, during the seven years his band existed before releasing their first album,1987’sBrave Words. In finally recording them, Phillipps had to grapple with his twentysomething self. “A 60-year-old man couldn’t just stick to the lyrics of those formative years,” heexplained. “Some of the songs were just vague recollections, incomplete, only blossoming during recording.”\nTime’s weight onSpring Boardfeels even heavier now that Phillipps is no longer with us, having passed away last June at age 61. It was a shock given his recent comebacks, both personally and musically. After struggling for years with Hepatitis C (contracted accidentally during heroin use) and at one point given months to live, Phillippsconquered the diseasevia a rather miraculous experimental drug program. (His recovery was depicted movingly in the 2019 documentaryThe Chills: The Triumph and Tragedy of Martin Phillipps.) After nearly 20 years without releasing an album, the Chills roared back in the mid-2010s, generating three excellent LPs and touring internationally.\nIt’s unclear exactly how Phillipps revised the songs onSpring Boardbefore recording them, but it’s hard not to hear them in light of the turns his life took in the last 20 years. Take “Watching Old Home Movies,” a self-consciously retrospective song about seeing history through clear if bewildered eyes. “Projector rattles out my past/People over-exposed who move too fast,” he sings over an upbeat but melancholy melody, “As seen through tiny child’s eyes/Leaves me cold, sad, and wise.” During the wry “Such Self Pity,” he chides his former neediness, even referencing the “needle still stuck in my arm.” And on the chugging “Declaration,” his urgent exhortations to “sort things out/Set things straight” rhymes with hisdecisionto organize and sell hisvast collectionof music and memorabilia.\nAt other points onSpring Board, Phillipps’ bouts with time could’ve been written, well, at any time. On the resolute “Juicy Creaming Soda,” Phillipps revisits a familiar theme of facing the past and shedding regrets: “When all the changes are made/Try to understand that the choice was mine.” During the album’s most hypnotic track, “If This World Was Made for Me,” he conjures a dream universe in which we all “open up our hearts and say exactly how we feel” (this fantasy also includes “24 hours of great TV”). Over a rushing swell of guitars in “Steel Skies,” he confronts the changing of the seasons, picking the darkness of winter over the heat of summer. “I Saw Your Silhouette,” a swinging meditation on encountering the specter of an old friend, expresses a haunting similar to the Chills’ signature song, “Pink Frost,” though it’s far sunnier than that wistful classic."

    "review_text": "WhenStudio, the duo of Dan Lissvik and Rasmus Hägg, named their 2006 albumWest Coast, they weren’t talking about California. Part of the southwest coast of Sweden, where the two lived, in Gothenburg, is an archipelago of more than 20 islands. Some are inhabited year round, with weatherbeaten cabins dotting the craggy landscape.\nYou can easily travel to the archipelago from Gothenburg’s city center, a simple day trip, one that moves you from the urban to the fantastical in about an hour. Technically, you don’t even leave Gothenburg; the islands are part of the same municipality. It’s easy to imagine Lissvik and Hägg as teenage boys escaping school, riding the ferry, island hopping, writing songs in their head.\nLissvik and Hägg, who met in their early 20s, have said they hopedWest Coastwould reflect the region’s landscape. But how do you translate such diverse geography, a bustling metropolis whose city limits encompass such breathtaking idyll? With acerbic guitar, funky bass, and the occasional lusty mouth sound. The music, a mix of house, disco, pop, and indie rock, works as both a nod to the desire to escape the confines of the city and a soundtrack for when you make it out.\nIn the 2000s, Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, was host to a small scene of musicians making a mix of music similar to Studio, all punching above their weight in terms of international acclaim. Studio were no exception. But their music was idiosyncratic. It was damp, hedonistic,deep. It felt out of time, both familiar and futuristic, as, 19 years later, it still does. In imitating something ancient, they made something eternal.\nThe album’s thesis statement may be its second song, “West Side,” a track that appears to move at two speeds at once. There is the syrupy bass—thump, thump, thump-thump-thump—contrasted with the feisty guitar. All types of percussion ripple throughout; against a stuttered backbeat, the song is accented with the type of hand drums that elevated the most potent ’70s disco anthems. There is a light electronic flourish, a pleasant echo. Then, about four minutes in, everything comes to a pause. The guitar whispers. This is one of Studio’s few songs with vocals, and you hear Lissvik repeating what could be the band’s motto: “Solid good times.” Is it over? Of course not. The final three minutes are a redoubling of their efforts, the extended coda working as a rejoinder to the idea that too much is never enough.\nFor all their maximalist instincts, Studio work deftly. The album is like a souffle, many ingredients go into making the final product as light as air.West Coast’s opener, “Out There” is a massive 15-minute track with finely plucked guitar, new wave bass, and simple, incantatory drums that seem like the band’s call to join them on the beach. There are hints ofDonna Summer, glistening ’80 prog rock, and also “Hey Mickey.” TakeGiorgio Moroderout of Studio 54 and ship him to Scandinavia and you’d be onto something. “Self Service” echoesthe Cureby way of weed. “Life’s a Beach,” with its mechanical handclaps, echoesKraftwerk… by way of weed. It’s dreamy music for people whose dreamworld was conveniently accessible by public transit. It’s music for confident people, people familiar with their fantasy becoming reality."

    "review_text": "Buscabulla’s Raquel Berrios and Luis Alfredo Del Valle, partners in life and art, make music that flits between humid synth exercises and soft-focus ballads. The pair’s debut album, 2020’sRegresa, reflected on their native Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria through pensive lyrics and relaxed grooves, a breakthrough that led to a standoutfeatureonBad Bunny’s 2022 blockbusterUn Verano Sin Ti. Part of Buscabulla’s charm is the airy synchronicity between Berrios’ soprano and Del Valle’s instrumentation, which adds a lightness to their sound even as they zero in on weighty issues like colonization and self-doubt. On Buscabulla’s second albumSe Amaba Así, the pair shift focus by breaking down a friction point in their own relationship with surprising candor. In smoldering synth-pop thick with references to interpersonal conflict, the duo creates an engaging blend of styles that draws back the curtain on the spinier moments in their life.\nWriting the new LP poked at tender emotional bruises for Buscabulla. (“A veces quiero ser yo/Porque siempre somos nosotros,” Berrios admits on “De Lejito”: “Sometimes I want to be me/Because we are always us.”) “At first, I was like,Why are you doing this?” Del Vallesaidabout first reading Berrios’ frank lyrics, which draw from the melodramatic Latin power ballads and salsa songs of her youth to examine trust and codependency. The forthright approach, however, is a potent one, drip-feeding a sense of drama into the band’s usual breezy sound. Berrios adopts a sing-song staccato on “Te Fuiste” to depict a push-and-pull before a possible breakup. She eventually relents on the song’s bridge, just as rhythmic percussion plumes through the song’s misty synths: “Fuimos dos niños/Que nunca aprendimos/El juego del romance” (“We were two children/That never learned/The game of romance”). “Miraverahí,” meanwhile, is among the band’s best songs, a spangled, disco-flecked synth-pop highlight cruising on a sturdy bassline that belies the song’s core heartbreak, both calling out a lack of affection and threatening to leave for good.\nSe Amaba Asíembellishes that emotional turmoil with a new addition: Del Valle takes lead on vocals for the first time. In a crooning baritone on “El Empuje,” he offers a flipside to Berrios’ songs; Del Valle wants to risk it all for her, no matter the possible mutual destruction that may come, giving a perceptive counterpoint to her previous storms of uncertainty. The album’s affecting title track eventually weaves their voices together against lullaby-soft backing vocals; here, Berrios sings of having inherited relationship habits in sparse, moving details. Trying to sort out why her parents have grown distant from one another, she finds she’s repeating the same story: “Me acostumbré/Pensaba que/Se amaba así” (“I got used to it/I thought that’s/The way love was”). When Del Valle joins in for the second chorus, they both seem to recognize the cycle in themselves and each other, determined to make an effort to purge it from their lives and start fresh.\nThe duo achieve that sense of renewal toward the album’s final songs. The standout “Mi Marido” is a swooning declaration of love, opening with a sample lifted from Paquitín Soto’s “Se Vende un Corazón” (Soto and Berrios both hail from Arecibo, a city on the northern coast of Puerto Rico). The song then blooms into a warm mix of guitar, drums, and güiro, floating around Berrios’ incandescent chorus: “Aunque no estuviera escrito/Te decía mi marido,” Berrios sings (“Even if it wasn’t written/I called you my husband”). As on the rest ofSe Amaba Así, Buscabulla effortlessly turns trouble in paradise into nourishment for the soul.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Folding seemingly incompatible elements into a blend that’s both natural and outlandish, the veteran post-rockers have never been easy to define—they only stopped evolving when they hung up their hat in 2009. The Groop regrouped in 2019;Instant Holograms on Metal Filmis the band’s first studio album in 15 years. But despite a tracklisting that reads almost likeparody—“Mystical Plosives,” “Vermona F Transistor,” the quintessentially ’Lab-esque “Esemplastic Creeping Eruption”—the record doesn’t suggest any particularly easy answers.\nWe knowwhothey are: guitaristTim Gane, singerLaetitia Sadier, and a cast of bandmates gathered around the former romantic couple’s Anglo-French alliance. We know that they formed in London in the early ’90s and powered through a raft of studio albums before splitting in 2009. But the band’s fundamental essence has always been difficult to capture: a slippery mixture of krautrock, yé-yé, electronics, easy listening, avant-garde collage, and left-wing politics that shifts, twitches, and mutates whenever you get it under the microscope. Stereolab are relentlessly shape-shifting—yet they always sound exactly like themselves.\nInstant Holograms on Metal Filmbrings a new producer (Bitchin Bajas’ Cooper Crain), new musicians (jazz cornetistBen LaMar Gay, percussionist Ric Elsworth), and new vocalists (including Marie Merlet, formerly of Sadier’sMonade) into the Stereolab orbit. Nevertheless, the album sounds resolutely Stereolab. Most of the key qualities that define the band are present and correct—motorik chug, bubbling Moogs, odd analog squiggles, and, above all, Sadier’s vocals, cool but engaged, glowing with the discreet passion of a hotel lobby rendezvous. The record also has touches of the radical vocal interplay that Sadier and the late Mary Hansen perfected in Stereolab’s mid-’90s imperial phase, when the two singers transcended rockist ideas of lead and backing vocal in favor of a gorgeously interlaced, ego-free fusion.\nThe band’s characteristic mid-song switch-ups also appear frequently, swaggering in with the unexpected emotional jolt of a visit from a friend you’d forgotten you missed. Halfway through “Immortal Hands,” a strutting drum-machine rhythm kicks the hitherto languid song into a newly animated phase. “Melodie is a Wound,” meanwhile, adds a sunnyBeach Boys-and-synths coda to the song’s baroque melancholia that builds to a furiously fuzzed-up climax. At moments like these, Stereolab’s music feels both intricately planned and strangely loose, with the telepathic connection of a well-drilled jazz quintet or a jam band with decades of experience in the collective fanny pack.\nBut as soon as you zoom in a little and try to work out exactly which Stereolab recordsInstant Holograms on Metal Filmreminds you of, the possibilities spiral out of control. The album is animated by the great electrical thrust of early Stereolab, for instance in the galloping motorik beat of “Electrified Teenybop!” (albeit minus the visceral guitar rush of those first records); it sports the influence of jazz, which bubbles up through the bewitching chord progressions of “Immortal Hands”; there areDots and Loopselectronic touches on “Mystical Plosives” and the even moreDots-esque marimba on “Immortal Hands”; not to mention the the plasticky, retro-futuristic charm of the antiquated drum-machine tick on “Colour Television.”Instant Holograms on Metal Filmsounds like the Platonic idea of Stereolab, rather than being a repeat of any particular LP, which is a neat trick for a reunion album to pull off."

    "review_text": "WhenPatterson Hoodwas 8 years old, he started writing songs. Bullied at school and making bad grades anyway, he jotted down lyrics in his notebook during class, even dreamed up a few concept albums. Around that same time, he became obsessed with Disney’sPinocchio, memorizing full scenes and acting them out by himself in the yard. The film’s dark tone piqued his imagination, in particular all the alarming transformations: boys into donkeys, wood into flesh, children into grown-ups. Perhaps the 8-year-old Patterson even wrote a song about it. Fifty years later, the adult Patterson penned “Pinocchio,” a quiet, bouncy ballad about what constitutes happiness later in life: “Heaven is a house with a modern kitchen/Heaven has the pace of a slow news day.” Buried in its cartoon imagery is a meditation on songwriting and Hood’s endless pursuit “for a line that can save my soul.”\n“Pinocchio” closes outExploding Trees & Airplane Screams, the fourth official album under theDrive-By Truckersco-founder’s own name—his first solo release in nearly 13 years, his most adventurous and surprising, and his best. These new songs are almost self-consciously rooted in his love of film (“cinematic wet streets reflect the clouds,” he sings on “The Forks of Cypress”), but they have the weirdness ofPinocchio.One of the foremost chroniclers of the modern, deeply conflicted South, Hood shows a penchant for striking surrealism, for jarring juxtapositions that render otherwise mundane images strange and unsettling. Opener “Exploding Trees,” for example, documents a particularly violent ice storm that hit his north Alabama hometown in 1994. He describes waterlogged trees crashing under the weight of ice, “like fireworks in the ice storm.” That description alone is memorable, but the song concludes with yet another evocative image, of “the Beauty Queen/Crushed beneath the pines on the frozen street.”\nIt's always tempting to think of albums like this as short-story collections, butExploding Treesis more akin to aCriterioncompilation of short films. Hood, who has penned songs about John Ford, Walt Disney, and other filmmakers, writes with visuals in mind, which means his lyrics tend toward the starkly descriptive. “A Werewolf and a Girl,” a duet withLydia Loveless, describes two deeply broken people trying to get comfortable with each other as they watchAn American Werewolf in Londonand have the most desultory sex imaginable. It’s a supremely bleak breakup song, but it’s a ray of light compared to “The Pool House,” which strings together a series of images that coalesce into a story about a man contemplating suicide. Hood sets it up as a movie scene, with the character taking one last skinnydip before hanging himself outside the pool house. In sharp contrast to the angry suicide song he wrote forDecoration Dayand the grieving suicide song he wrote forWelcome 2 Club XIII,“The Pool House” is almost spookily matter-of-fact, as Hood struggles to understand such a self-annihilating act: “How could his head tell him something so wrong and make it feel so right?”"

The stacked vocal harmonies and avant-pop collagism of 2007’sPerson Pitchfelt like a post-Endtroducing…version ofPet Sounds, and he’s flirted heavily with reggae; see the shoutout toKing TubbyinPerson Pitch’s liner notes or the311ish digi-boing of “Crosswords,” from 2015’sPanda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper(an album whose title is itself adub reference). But for most ofSinister Grift, his first solo release since 2019’s aquatic confessionalBuoys, he goes full cowabunga: Lennox’s body’s in the sand, there’s a tropical drink melting in his hand, and he’s contemplating his crumbling love to the rhythm of a reggae-rock band.\nSinister Griftfollows Lennox’s excellent 2022 collaboration withSonic Boom,Reset. With its overlapping early rock and doo-wop samples, and some of Lennox’s sharpest melodies in years, that album felt both like a return to the heady days ofPerson Pitchand completely unbothered by the weight of expectation. Even as they dealt in heartbreak and loss, the songs were casual, at ease, nearly weightless. That same energy carries intoSinister Grift, which Lennox recorded in his Lisbon home studio withAnimal CollectivebandmateDeakinhandling production.Avey TareandGeologistalso appear, making this the first solo album to feature all four members of Animal Collective; so does Lennox’s partner,Spirit of the Beehive’s Rivka Ravede. IfSinister Griftoften sounds like a bunch of old friends and loved ones getting together to jam while the meat sizzles on the grill, well, it is.\nTheir disarmingly laid-back approach marksSinister Griftas the least experimental and most accessible record in the Animal Collective universe. On first spin, its relative simplicity makes it seem as though the album is lacking some of Lennox’s greatest tricks as an arranger. He long ago mastered the ability to both build and complicate tension (think of the way the breaks in “Brother Sport” are ratcheted up by the steady introduction of secondary and tertiary rhythms) and juice its release (“Matt!”). There are very few commanding polyrhythms here, and you’ll never be bricked out by clashing textures the way you might with, say,Tomboy’s “Surfer’s Hymn.” Amusingly, despite being rooted in reggae,Sinister Griftis the least dubby record Lennox has ever released, with echo, staccato repetitions, and decontextualized FX kept to a minimum. When a spring of noise finally uncorks in “Ferry Lady,” it doesn’t overwhelm the song but simply burbles in the margins, closer in spirit to the refined pop of “I Am the Walrus” than the disorienting misdirections of “Bros.”"

    "review_text": "In Kelly Reichardt’s 2006 dramaOld Joy,a shot of a small town’s lights disappearing into the black cloak of the Cascadian forest says as much as anything that comes from the lips of its two protagonists, played by Daniel London andWill Oldham. They’re old friends who haven’t seen each other in years, one settling into domestic life and the other still on the hippie trail, and Reichardt doesn’t ask the men to fuss and fight to show them drifting away from each other and into their respective corners of middle age. Instead, she allows the seemingly limitless expanse of the Oregon landscape to stand in for the distance between the men as they drive deep into the Cascades on a camping trip. If there’s anything explicitly underlining the loneliness of the two men’s situation, it’s the soundtrack, recorded byYo La Tengowith veteran session guitarist Smokey Hormel.\nThat score was previously available in truncated form on the compilationThey Shoot, We Score,buried among material from the band’s other recent soundtracks. A new reissue from Mississippi Records expands those same six themes into a 26-minute EP. This isn’t a complete record of the music in the film—Hormel’s diegetic honky-tonk pastiche “Memories of Abilene” is absent, and the alternate version of “Leaving Home” onThey Shoot, We Scorehas been swapped for one with a more deeply swung beat—but the curation holds together as a lovely little driving album.\nThe music is a sort of countrified krautrock, somewhere between the seductively lugubrious style of the band’s early-2000s releases and the ambient guitar music of the contemporaneous Kranky Records actLabradford. It’s road music, but paced for a short drive with a lot to think about rather than the exhilaration of the freeway. (“Daphnia,” released onI Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Assthe same year as Reichardt’s film, is an exclave of this specific style.) Hormel and YLT guitarist Ira Kaplan affect a slight Western twang, the same kind established in cinematic grammar to imply the wide-open spaces of the American interior, with each note seeming to bleed and dissipate into the vastness of the world like smoke from one of the Oldham character’s endless joint puffs.\nThe music was recorded loosely and quickly in Yo La Tengo’s famed Hoboken studio, but what sounds like ambient rumination at first has a real melodic grace. Piano and guitar find spooky overtones on “Getting Lost,” and Hubley’s drums drop out to mirror the characters’ confusion as they try vainly to interpret their road map in the dimming forest light. “End Credits” is a motorik that never gets out of first gear. Most striking is “Driving Home,” with an uncommonly elegant chord progression that hints at a resolution without containing much of one at all. Even in such an improvisational environment, the lessons in popcraft Yo La Tengo have learned from decades of writing pop songs and covering the artists who inspire them shine through effortlessly."

    "review_text": "To promote her seventh canonical album,MAYHEM,Lady Gagalaunched a charm offensive. From holding court in afans-only press conferenceto turns onSNL,Hot Ones, andVanity Fair’s lie detectorseries, she has projected an endearingly down-to-earth persona. She even received a question about “reheating nachos”—gay stan chatter suggesting she rehashed old musical ideas in her single “Abracadabra”—with grace. “My nachos are mine and I invented them, and I’m proud of them,”she toldEW.\nTalk about truth in advertising:MAYHEMis its own charm offensive, a massive attack of good vibes. It is a project designed to remind listeners why they fell in love with her in the first place, before the jazz belting or the traditional singer-songwriter gravitas or movie stardom. Inspiration from fiancé Michael Polansky, entrepreneur and one of the album’s executive producers, to return to her pop roots prompted an internal survey—Gaga toldEWthat instead of seeking to reinvent her sound, “I started to think about what makes meme? What are my references? What are my inspirations?”MAYHEM, then, isn’t the sound of someone reheating her nachos on the sly and trying to pass them off as fresh—it’s a full-on cooking show devoted to the art of nacho-reheating.\nIf it sounds strange to say that it’s good to have Gaga back, it’s probably because she’s never really stayed away for too long. Between her proper sixth album, 2020’sChromatica, andMAYHEM, Gaga played her Vegas residency and toured the world; was the best thing in two bad movies, 2021’sHouse of Gucciand 2024’sJoker: Folie à Deux; and released a companion album for the latter, the covers-heavyHarlequin. She has the rare distinction of appealing to both rockist and poptimist ideals, practically in equal measure. On one hand she plays the piano, executes high concepts with ease, and writes her own (often autobiographical) material. On the other, she isfascinated by artifice, puts major emphasis on the visual component of her image, loves synthesizers and programming, and is an unabashed scholar of fame. She is a champion of underdogs (calling for trans compassion in heracceptance speechat this year’s Grammys, for example) but also a good case for celebrity exceptionalism and the draw of meritocracy. She is just like us, except obviously better.\nGaga’s expressed trepidation to return to pop is all overMAYHEM—one of its prominent themes is inner conflict. You can watch multiple Gagas face off against each other in the videos for two of its vicious singles, “Disease” and “Abracadabra.” In album highlight “Perfect Celebrity,” she observes her public-life counterpart “asleep on the ceiling,” haunting her private persona. Over a melange of sound that she has accurately dubbed “electro grunge” she snarls, “You love to hate me! I’m the perfect celebrity!” Her rage is a surprise reveal, given how generally loved, scandal-averse, and unfailingly polite Gaga has been. LikeMadonna’s 1998Ray of Light,MAYHEMplays with the concept of fame and the oddness of its condition without drawing firm conclusions. The potentially lofty rendering of this identity war does not get in the way of a good time, and the album often has the energy of a wrestling match. WhereasBeyoncéphysically separated the “real” her and her exaggerated performer persona on 2008’s two-discI Am… Sasha Fierce,Gaga smashes her two sides together onMAYHEM."

Let go of what does not serve you. Or, quoting Alana Haim in the press release, “Every single song has a theme of quitting something that isn’t working for us anymore.”I quitalso proudly advertises its credentials as American rock’n’roll, quoting Abraham Lincoln and Bruce Springsteen in opener “Gone,” exploring acoustic folk with fresh attention on soon-to-be-underappreciated hits like “Love You Right” and “Blood on the Street,” and inviting co-producerRostam Batmanglij’s love of vintage acoustic texture, breakbeats, and left-field sound design into a combination of influences that sometimes goes a little haywire.\nThat’s right, it’s those same girls who madeWomen in Music Pt. III: They sense your impulse to treat them like a grown-up Sweet Valley High triple threat doing a band because it really does make for great content—all thatpurposeful walking!—and they know it doesn’t matter how many stone-cold classic rock references you make or how many surreally cool Paul Thomas Anderson projects you star in, some people are never going to treat you like the other guys. Not that there’s anything wrong with making pop music! They are, in their own words, “becoming the band we’ve always wanted to be.”\nTalk like this gives me a migraine, but as I understand it,I quitis announcing its intention to be as emotional, self-indulgent, conflicted, silly, stoned, and heartsick as any woman on Stevie Nicks’ green Earth has a right to be. LikeMUNA, Haim are chanting a hook about doing “what[ever] I want.” Like onSolar Power,they’reinterpolatingone ofGeorge Michael’s all-time biggest hits. (“HAIM dug deeper into the pop archives and sampled… ‘Freedom! ’90,’” writes the author of this album’s official bio, who’s never been below sea level.) The sound is sturdy but a little more laid-back, even for this famously sun-dazed group. The problem is thatI quitis uneven, even within songs: often equivocating instead of disarming, partially vested in several musical directions, sometimes landing a devastating blow, and sometimes vastly overshooting its lyrical ambitions.\nImagine going out with a bang: what you’d say, to whom.I quitstarts so strong: “Can I have your attention please/For the last time before I leave?” Danielle Haim begins, and then, “On second thought I changed my mind.” As in real life,I quit’s declarative force is shadowed by indecision and the accumulated weight of all one’s previous choices. Or: “Wasting time driving through the Eastside/Doing my thing ’cause I can’t decide if we’re through,” as Haim put it to a dusty hopscotch beat on will-they-or-won’t-they-break-up lead single “Relationships,” a pool-party jam with an appropriately tortured backstory that pays off for a reportedly challenging recording process that overlapped Danielle and longtime producer Ariel Rechtshaid’s breakup."

    "review_text": "The bestMaxo Kreamsongs feel like Spike Leedolly shots: focusing tightly on a character while slowly tilting their world off its axis. “Roaches,” from the Texas rapper’s breakout release,Punken, nimbly shifted from rosy childhood nostalgia for FUBU and Limewire to an anxious adult account of trying to protect his family during a hurricane. “Spice Ln.,” fromBrandon Banks, began with a proud rundown of his street rep and morphed into a twisty trap saga that’s tragic and funny. Autobiography fuels Maxo’s storytelling, but he is at heart a stylist who molds experiences and syllables like clay.\nHe spent 2021’sWeight of the Worldflexing his range as he cruised over throwback trill, smoky soul loops, and wavy trap. Although the narratives weren’t as vivid as those onBrandon Banks, the songwriting was polished and dynamic. The varied soundscape highlighted the elasticity of his flows and coaxed out fleeter storytelling. He attempts a similar showcase onPersonification, a collection of goon, swag, and cloud rap billed as a reflective spin through his career so far. But there’s not much of an arc to the Maxo Kream Künstlerroman. These feckless songs just feel like facsimiles of his past work.\nThe déjà vu is meant to demonstrate growth and progress, but the callbacks and echoes are more often redundant. Brooding opener “Mo Murda” blandly rehashes ideas about the overlap between religion and gang life that Maxo already explored with verve on “Cripstian” fromWeight of the World. It doesn’t help that the middling verse builds to Maxo cornily labeling himself a “hypo-Crip,” a pun evenAb-Soulwould steer clear of. ”Drizzy Draco 2” recycles aBrandon Bankssong title for a lesser track that combines two lines from earlier inPersonification: “All my opps can go to hell, they can’t live on Earth no more/I’m the Crip John Wick, turn a opp to John Doe.” The bars weren’t even memorable the first time he said them.\nThe constant retreading is dizzying. “Cracc Era” again pairs Maxo withTyler, the Creatorfor mixtape-era shit-talking that’s fun but derivative of their 2021 team-up “Big Persona.” “Smokey” harks back to “Big Worm” fromThe Persona Tape, using theFridaycharacters for a generic street tale about repaying debts. Memphis horrorcore track “Triggaman” repurposes ad-libs from Maxo’s 2016 song “Hit Mane,” but isn’t as scenic or menacing; the livelyDenzel Curryfeature is the only saving grace. Familiarity can be an effective setup for surprise or refinement, but these songs frustratingly spin in place."

    "review_text": "The artist known until now asUlla, orUlla Straus, makes music so delicate it’s almost weightless, propelled less by a guiding hand than by the mercurial drift of air particles warmed by the first rays of the sun. At their gentlest, Ulla’s ambient miniatures seem to consist of little more than a soft breeze brushing against guitar strings, or dust motes settling between the keys of the synthesizer.\nUlla’s public profile is just as inconspicuous. Moving between Kansas, California, Pennsylvania, and Germany, they have slipped often between aliases (Foamy, Pepper) and coyly named collaborative projects (sofa, wiggle room, LOG). One early moniker, Ulla Anona, came with an implicit suggestion of secrecy. Now they’re justU.e., on a new label—their own?—called 28912, which might be a date, or a zip code, or maybe a combination scribbled on a faded Post-it, the lock in question long since lost or rusted shut. The mysteriousness of their music invites such speculations.\nHometown Girlis as quiet as anything Ulla has done until now, but an important shift has taken place. Instead of the softly burbling electroacoustic sound design ofTumbling Towards a Wallor the intricate digital swirls offoam, the new album foregrounds an almost purely acoustic palette: clean-toned guitar; woodwinds laid on like strips of cotton batting; watery piano, redolent of mildew and mothballs, with the creaky beach-house vibe ofGrouper’sRuins. Ulla even plays drums on a few songs, tapping away at the cymbals and toms with slow, careful movements.\nThis isn’t the first time Ulla has worked with acoustic materials. Sax and piano wandered throughLimitless Frame’s lonely hallways, and guitar, piano, and voice were at the root offoam’s glitchy catalysis. But this is the first time the artist has sounded virtually unplugged. On previous albums, the instrumental touches often wore the telltale marks of digital manipulation; here, Ulla might as well be laying down parts on a thrifted Tascam Portastudio. You can sense the fingers on the strings, the dimensions of the room, the blankets draped in lieu of soundproofing. On “Gecko,” a voice that darts out from behind strummed guitar sounds less like singing than a private, spontaneous vocalization, likeKeith Jarrettmurmuring absent-mindedly at his piano.\nThat sense of presence is partly illusory, a product of the record’s low-key production trickery. On “Little Window,” which features the album’s first real singing, their voice arrives wreathed in reverb, as though they were singing from the other end of an underpass. The a cappella “Song for Hill,” just a minute long, might be a phone recording of a lullaby captured through the bedroom wall. And a few tracks melt blissfully into the digital haze of their earlier work: “Drain the House” comes on in rolling, bass-heavy waves of ambience, while “Froggy Explorer” and “Night Loop” recallFennesz’s stompbox meditations, scraps of guitar caught like flotsam in the digital tide. But the overall impression is a kind of lo-fiTalk Talk, every element quietly holding its own in a candle-lit room; or the casual, congenial vibe ofG.S. Schray,K. Freund, and the ambient-jazz jam sessions of the Akron scene."

    "review_text": "Lyra Pramukstarted singing at a young age, yet she always felt like a musical outsider. She cut her teeth in Pennsylvania church choirs before attending conservatory, her ostensible plan to be an operatic baritone; in her 20s, she shifted gears and became a denizen of Berlin dancefloors. Her destination has always been more idiosyncratic than anything she could find in a particular medium, genre, or career model. “I only set out to make an album because everyone told me I had to,” Pramuk self-effacingly toldThe Quietusin 2020, hot on the heels of her now-classic debut,Fountain. “I’ve been very much in my own world, so I feel kind of naïve about all of this. I’m more likely to want to talk about Susan Sontag or aesthetics.”\nFountainwas composed entirely of Pramuk’s voice, which she manipulated, distorted, and layered. It was a minimal album, not necessarily in the vein ofSteve ReichorPhilip Glass, nor because it sounded stripped down—Pramuk created a cavernous, haunting sense of space out of just one instrument. Her secret sauce was software, yetFountainsmacked of ancient feats of ingenuity, reminiscent of the way cultures that persisted for millennia without modern technology could create mind-boggling works from sparse natural resources. The record’s lush vocals feel even more prophetic today than they did five years ago—Pramuk harvested the digital fruits of the nascent 2020s to nourish herself for the deprivations of an unknown future.\nHer follow-up fosters a similarly organic sensibility, though it takes a different route to the core.Hymnalis unabashedly maximalist: Pramuk embraces varied collaborators, including chamber ensemble the Sonar Quartett, and processes drawn from literature, visual art, and botany. Her vocal performance emerged from a set of unconventional instructions: She used verse by the poet Nadia Marcus as the basis for a “geographical biology experiment” she built with the artist Jenna Sutela. This sculpture-cum-habitat was littered with Marcus’ words, on top of which Pramuk placed oats; she then documented the growth of a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, while it overtook the grains, letting its path dictate the lyrics. Pramuk’s intricate, labor-intensive technique places her in a long lineage of composers who use chance operations and alternative musical notation systems, though her score singularly fits her vision. Life, she tells us, finds a way.\nHymnalis a planet of sound, teeming with life, that seems even more habitable thanFountain—a bountiful ecosystem experiencing a permanent May and June. The album’s execution is tech-forward, yet tactile. Wielding a CDJ, Pramuk plaits violin, viola, cello, flute, double bass, and handclaps into her own treated singing and speech. The seeds of the LP are human, packed with the same mystifying DNA as its predecessor: Pramuk’s voice, which feels incantatory, and maintains its personhood past the augmentation of technology and the constancy of change."

Now, as he enters his 30s, Benito has paused to reflect on this unprecedented moment: a time when música urbana has surged onto the global stage and risks being diluted by its own commodification. He could’ve recruited the biggest names in Latin music to chase more Grammys and streams. Instead, Bad Bunny returned to his beloved Puerto Rico, forging a deeper connection to his community and producing his most profound statement yet. In a fraught political moment following the victory of Donald Trump and adevastating lossfor the Puerto Rican Independence Party in the 2024 election, Bad Bunny’s sixth studio album,DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS(I Should Have Taken More Photos), is a bold declaration—a groundbreaking testament to his evolved artistry and vision for the future of música urbana.\nIts release date, January 5th, marks not just the eve of Día de los Reyes (Three Kings Day) but a week of historical significance for Puerto Ricans. Roughly 157 Januaries ago, Bori revolutionaries established the Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico during political exile in the Dominican Republic, drafted thefirst flagin solidarity with Dominican and Cuban designs, and sparked el Grito de Lares in 1868, the island’s first armed uprising against Spanish colonial rule. Though the rebellion was crushed, its cultural and political symbolism had sown the seeds for Puerto Rican identity and independence. On album opener “NUEVAYoL,” Bad Bunny launches his own musical revolution in New York City, where exiled Grito participants produced the familiarsky-blue Bandera, a symbol of independence and defiance.\n“NUEVAYoL” sets the fuse with 20 seconds of El Gran Combo’s 1975 salsa hit “Un Verano en Nueva York” before igniting into an explosion of Dominican dembow madness. It’s a savvy collision of past and present that swings a machete through the Boricua musical fabric. The smallest of details, like the crisp, reverberating crack of a home run or the mention of salsa icon Willie Colón’s debut,El Malo—prodigious boogaloo compositions recorded when he was only 16—are romantic in a distinctly Boricua way.DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToSis studied, deliberate, and intricate, interpolating multiple generations of Puerto Rican rhythms: Salsa, plena, bolero, and old-school perreo paired with today’s Latin pop and música urbana. Bad Bunny, ever the perreo scholar, lets the hand drums and Afro-Indigenous sounds live right alongside the hypnotic synth lines and sub-rattling bass."

He made his name on moody and volatile odes to strippers and bottle girls, but nothing has ever mattered more to him than getting love from the men he wanted to be. It was why his role asLil Wayne’s protégé meant everything to him. It was why he torpedoed hisdebut albumwith wannabeKanyesongs and used it as an excuse to rub shoulders withJay-Z,T.I., andJeezy. It was why getting laughed out of the room byPusha Ton “The Story of Adidon” made his music so easily become mean and cynical—the romance was never really the point.\nThat’s the case with$ome $exy $ongs 4 U, too. It’s the most R&B-centric Drake project sinceSo Far Goneand the situations and situationships aren’t that much different than they were in 2009. He’s once again unwittingly the butt of the joke, getting punked by rap’s tough guys and their fetishists. (Remember whenCommondusted off the “The Bitch in Yoo” vibes just to call Drakesoft?) He’s once again embarrassingly melodramatic. (Did you see therecent videoof him walking out to the “Over My Dead Body” instrumental at a show in Australia with smoking bullet holes altered into his sweatshirt?) He’s once again desperate for the heavyweights of Atlanta or Houston or New York to reach out and tell himwe fuck with you.In his twenties, all of that made him sort of endearingly corny, real, and funny. Now? He can’t just bring out the wintertime beats, the strip-club sulking, the voicemail interludes, the Keith Sweat begging, and expect that suddenly, everyone who once loved him will come running back.

He’s doing his best to act chill about it, but trust me, he’s shaking likeBig Pussy before he got whacked. Using stories of various romances as a buffer, Drake cries out to us to keep his dream of being ultra-famous and powerful alive: “Thought I laid that shit out perfect, put it on the floor/Put it on my son, I put it on the Lord/What else can I swear on girl? There’s nothing more,” he sings over almost nothing but finger-snaps on “CN Tower.” And I’m a sucker for the pageantry, like the moment on “Moth Balls” when a woman’s melancholic voice drops in with, “I just hoped that someday, someone would love me” right as the beat mutates into a cloud of gloom.

You might be momentarily reminded ofHiroshi Yoshimura,Steve Reich, ’90s ambient, and fantastical video-game soundtracks, yet the references float by so gently and swiftly that you’re too swept up in the downy tumult to think too closely about them. But there’s a moment on Yetsuby’s new album4EVAthat’s so uncharacteristically strident, it might make you wonder if someone else’s audio files got mixed in with hers on the way to the mastering engineer.\n“SOUNDCLOUD”—a title, a genre, a browser tab?—begins more or less like her most upbeat tracks typically do, with a beat made of balloon squeaks and finger snaps. But the offbeats are punctuated by what might be the trumpeting of a tetchy elephant; an agitated teakettle adds a dash of pandemonium. Egged on by rushing, rolling breakbeats, gruffly squawking cut-up vocals further stoke the frantic mood. It sounds like aBomb Squadtribute fronted by a harriedDizzee Rascaland recorded on a diet of Pop Rocks and Coke.\nThe garishness of the sensory overload marks the song as an outlier in Yetsuby’s catalog, but it shares the restlessly inventive spirit found in the rest of her work. In the context of the new album, “SOUNDCLOUD” signals Yetsuby’s refusal to fall back on old patterns. On4EVA, she’s determined to try new things, even if they risk damaging the veneer of her typically beatific music. It’s her most energetic record yet, heavily informed by contemporary club styles though rarely reducible to any one sound or mood.\nThe album opens with a fake-out. “s2WINGS s2” begins as a soft explosion of gold dust, filigreed layers of wordless Auto-Tune tracing curlicues atop thrumming chimes and dewdrop synths; it sounds a little bit likeSkrillex’s “With You, Friends (Long Drive)” reimagined by beatless techno wizBarker. It gathers steam as it goes, levels rising as though it’s about to peak in a concussive drop. Instead, having reached some imperceptible zenith, it simply dissolves into a fine spray of acoustic guitar artifacts, likeJim O’Rourke’sEurekarun through an atomizer. “FLY,” which follows, might be a remix of the same sound files: same tempo, same angelic coo, same pointillistic pastel rush. The drums are punchier, the groove more pronounced, but the predominant feeling is an almost overwhelming oxytocin glow, a tidal wave of bliss."

After all, he’s spent five albums disgusted with his own self-loathing and profusely apologizing for it. “Trust me, I get it,” he says with an eye roll on the opening track to their latest record,Who Will Look After the Dogs?But from the jump, PUP swapped pop-punk’s key traits of angst and apathy for depression and deep concern. It’s what gave the Toronto stalwarts an edge of maturity over their peers, even if they hid it bycrushing beer cansand pledging allegiance toperpetual heartbreak.\nThat perspective is rare within the genre, which rewards staying young at heart forever onstage. But eventually, performers stop recognizing the stickers on the green room’s scratched-up mirror and start noticing their crow’s feet instead. It’s a game of musical cryogenics where contestants likethe Wonder Yearsstill have to yell, “Jesus Christ, I’m 26!” at age 39, orthe Menzingersare still rhetorically askingwhat comes after your 20sas they stare down their 40s. Addressing the insecurities of aging without souring a melody is tricky, particularly when fans crave heart-pounding, carefree shout-alongs. Learning how to mature alongside your work, though, is what separates themiddle-age deniersfrom themindful adults. OnWho Will Look After the Dogs?,PUP has filled out an application form to join the latter demographic.\nThe lifelong struggle with mental health that Babcock sings about isn’t on his shoulders alone; all of his bandmates—guitarist Steve Sladkowski, bassist Nestor Chumak, and drummer Zack Mykula—haveconfessedto carrying that weight in their own lives at times. Thankfully, Babcock has learned to frame bouts of self-destruction as annoying obstacles to overcome, not justifications for self-pity, a distinction that allows PUP to act their age. When vindictive detractors once again taunt him on “Get Dumber,” he doesn’t take the bait. It helps that he’s literally got friends by his side, withJeff Rosenstocksharing vocal duties and exemplifying how to shrug off the stress, like filling in a forgotten line with “Ohhh,lyrics.” PUP wouldn’t be PUP without their intoxicating self-contempt or knowing winks to break the fourth wall. Here, however, there’s an air of responsibility when Babcock resists the urge to go all-in, as do his bandmates when dialing back their typically rowdy hooks a notch."

    "review_text": "The first album thatLoraine Jamesrecorded asWhatever the Weatheradvanced a novel concept: Each track was titled after a temperature reading on the Celsius scale, like “25°C” or “6°C,” meant to approximate the artist’s “emotional temperature” when she recorded it. You might imagine the tracklisting as a meteorological map, a patchwork of variegated blues and reds running from frigid cerulean to sweltering scarlet. But in contrast to that prescriptive rubric,Whatever the Weatherleft questions of relative heat or cold entirely up to the listener. Do the glitching pads of “17°C” sound more like breaking surf or branching ice crystals? Is the wistful piano of “14°C” more evocative of George Winston’s new-age classicAutumnor its sequel,Winter Into Spring? Some might consider that ambiguity a flaw, but I find it refreshing. How easy it could have been to sketch out a self-evident spectrum, from icy drones to balmy Balearic tones, and call it a day. James’ album suggested that synesthesia is as messy as our feelings themselves.\nShe sticks with the concept onWhatever the Weather II. This time, the metaphorical scale is a little less severe: from 1°C (a frosty 34°F) to 26°C (a summery but not oppressive 79°F), in contrast to the former album, which flitted between the freezing point and the brink of a heat wave. Perhaps accordingly, the new record’s stylistic range is comparatively abbreviated.Whatever the Weatherwandered freely across the tranquility of ambient, the itchy restlessness of IDM, and the aggression of drum’n’bass, even folding in a few vocal passages influenced by Midwestern emo.WtWIIis more focused, with a palette organized around muted synth pads, minimalist arrangements, and faint dustings of digital distortion. The last album often used ambient as a gateway to more unpredictable zones; on the new one, it’s a homing beacon.\nThe new album’s relative coherence might have something to do with the intent behind its making. The first album grew out of stray productions created during the recording of 2021’sReflection; it also included a few five-year-old project files that James had never found a home for. This time, she cleared her studio schedule in order to concentrate on new Whatever the Weather material, following a first-thought-best-thought approach—hardware synths, effects pedals, little in the way of overdubs—that favored intuition and flow.\nThe result is some of the most direct, spontaneous music in James’ catalog. Tracks feel less like songs or compositions than tone poems, mood pieces that flow naturally from one to the next, like clouds changing shape high overhead. After a brief scene-setting intro (“It’s a bit chilly, innit?” James muses over glitching pads and vocal samples in “1°C”), “3°C” pairs hopeful synth pads with faint glitches and squeals, suggesting the subtle drama of emotional liftoff; on the following “18°C,” the same chords curl inward and darken, sounding more guarded despite the ostensibly warmer forecast."

    "review_text": "Laurie Osborne and Adam Winchester have a way of bringing out the inner adventurer in each other. Not that the Berlin-based DJs have ever been boxed in by genre: Winchester first emerged from Bristol’s dubstep scene asWedgeand has grown into a voracious noise sculptor, even teaching seminars on sound design. Osborne, meanwhile, has touched on dub, breakbeat, techno, and garage under hisAppleblimmoniker. But together asWrecked Lightship, the two musicians tease an otherworldly club logic out of their combined sensibilities. Dubby basslines radiate with the soft glow of the setting sun. Alien synth stabs break apart like machinery casting off a crash-landing rocket. Every tone seems to be in the process of decay, crunching and crackling as if in the throes of their final transmission.\nWhere Wrecked Lightship’snebulous Peak Oil debut last yearleaned into their more abstract instincts,Drained Strands, their fourth album, ups the rhythmic factor considerably, incorporating molten textures into a more driving set of tracks. ThinkKenny Larkin’s cybernetic techno, but drenched in the hypnotic surface noise ofPoleand bolstered with the weight ofPorter Ricks’ mulched thump. It’s still better suited to sinking into your couch than tearing up the dancefloor, but Osborne and Winchester’s floating bass patterns and spine-tickling hi-hats imbue everything with a deathly urgency. Osborne delights in the tension between human imperfection and mechanical precision. “I like the idea of both always trying to do what the other can’t,” he hassaid: “Machines trying to sound human and humans trying to sound like machines.”Drained Strandscomes alive in the smeared interzone where technology fuses with the organic.\nWrecked Lightship’s music exists in a dark, dank world not unlike that of Osborne’s formerSkull Discolabel partnerShackleton, their rhythms so solvent they could slip through your fingers. Even the duo’s more straightforward songs thrive in their aqueous details: “Reeling Mist” bears their most clearly defined melody yet, but the real joy is in the staticky signals that roll up and down the track, or the swaying garage snare that click-clacks with just the right amount of echo. It’s a trip-hoppy piece of comedown lounge ammo; “Lagoon,” on the other hand, plunges straight into the abyss, as Osborne and Winchester ground their slippery downtempo claps with deep, enveloping rounds of throbbing bass. The title track opens the album on a magnificent charge, a time-warped footwork beat dodging between blood-red synths that flit like security beams in some dystopian jailbreak."

    "review_text": "“Dream pop” has always been a slight misnomer.Elizabeth Fraserconfronted new motherhood onHeaven or Las Vegas,Broadcast’s Trish Keenan toed the line between this world and the next,Mazzy Starmade a Magritte painting out of desire. Waking life was the concern in each case, and in each case the music obliged, warping to accommodate the surrealism of the everyday. To say “life itself is but a dream” is true in the most practical sense; light and color, the entire visual field, are simply what the brain hallucinates when photons ping your retina.\nAs New Zealand’sPhoebe Ringsexpanded from the solo project of singer and keyboardist Crystal Choi to a proper four-piece, the nominal dream pop band quickly approached the outer orbit of that designation. For their debut album,Aseurai, guitarist Simeon Kavanagh-Vincent, bassist Benjamin Locke, and drummer Alex Freer may as well have come into the studio armed with mops and feather dusters; now the record’s every surface glimmers and gleams. Together with Choi, they’ve taken the ingredients of Japanese city pop—disco, Brazilian jazz, ‘60s psychedelia—and layered them into airy trifles with stiff whipped peaks. “Aseurai means around you in the atmosphere, hard to reach, fading away,” Choi said of the album’s Korean title in a press statement accompanying its release, and here the dream pop ethos persists. Phoebe Rings may have their heads in the clouds, but these songs render loss as tangible, even quotidian, and vividly true to life.\nInspired by the ‘90s K-ballad “샴푸의 요정 (Fairy of Shampoo),”Aseurai’s opening and title track is the only one Choi opted to record in her mother tongue. The lyrics memorialize her grandmother, whose lingering spirit reappears in various guises—a blue butterfly, a shooting star—throughout the album: “May the falling light of faraway stars/Reach your fingertips and let you breathe.” Choi sings in Korean of “memories that bloom like the mist at dawn” and the band blooms in turn. Cinematic strings flirt with squelchy Moog synthesizers, and some impeccably arrangedBee Geesharmonies build up to a funky breakdown anchored by a classic Nile Rodgers riff. Dulcet and plainspoken, Choi’s voice could get lost in the twinkly haze, but as withthe Softies’ Rose Melberg, that twee approachability is sugar for the pill of her nuanced and frequently shattering emotions.\nWhile recordingAseurai, Phoebe Rings gathered once a week, every week, over the span of two years in what they came to call the “Sunday Sessions.” The band’s individual performances are each pristinely rendered and in perfect lockstep with one another. Locke’s dextrous, conversational bass playing on “Not a Necessity” and “Drifting,” earns the album its cheeky allusions to mirrorballs and “stains on suede.” “Static!”, his duet with Choi, is a wallflower’s anthem (“I can walk alone with you,” goes the song’s hook) and showcase for Choi’s classically trained jazz piano chops. Locke’s solo turn at the mic on “Get Up” is a rare leaden moment, his deadpan affect poorly suited for a call to “Just get up/Stop thinking where you should be/Let your body take the lead.” Even at its most danceable,Aseuraiis foremost for anyone liable to show up with a book at the discothèque.\nUnlike the finality of death, to give up on a relationship or personal aspiration is to never quite know when the mourning should begin. The stunning “Mandarin Tree” is Choi’s elegy for a certain millennial dream of domesticity, a “house up the street” surrounded by pink and white cherry blossoms. Color is the constant point of return in her songwriting; on “Not a Necessity” she sings of “motions of blue” and “the splash of rain turning everything deep green,” while the weightless jazz waltz “Playground Song” floats suspended in a perpetual orange sunset. Every hue on Choi’s celestial painter’s palette is as saturated with feeling and rich with association as anything this side of “Cherry Colored Funk.” “I see memories in one star/And love in another/And loneliness,” reads aKorean poemby Yun Dong-ju that Choi hascitedas an inspiration.Aseuraiis nearly blinding with starlight, but choose any lyric, any note, and chances are it still shines on its own."

    "review_text": "WhenJohn Faheyinvented modern fingerstyle guitar as we know it, he created a paradox. His lonesome style of ghost-town music conjured a way of American life that never truly existed—a place in his mind where Delta blues, ragtime, bluegrass, and Indian raga all rose naturally from the ground. Ironically, by doing so, he ended up with a new, very real tradition: Generation after generation of artists have attempted to evoke his specific vision of the people who live on this land, fighting against the current of popular music as they chase his tumbleweed across the desert.\nPerhaps even more so than the torchbearers that have inspired him,Hayden Pedigohas embraced the costume-like nature of this role. The Texas-bred fingerpicker has tended to shroud his soft, wilted music in a matrix of inside jokes and pranks. When he’s notrunning for local officeorwalking for Gucci, he’s making tongue-in-cheekinstructional videos on how to play his songs, and postingridiculous fit picson his Instagram. He performs in brightly pigmented Western shirts and sky-high Stetsons, looking either the spitting image ofHankhimself, or Woody fromToy Storydepending how you squint. There’s a long history of absurd costumes in the country world, fromGram Parsons’ weed-covered Nudie suit toRobbie Basho’s cowboy duds to Blaze Foley wrapping his clothes up in duct tape. Until now, Pedigo has indulged in this sense of playacting, dressing the part of the old-world troubadour even as hewaxesabout how inspiring the early-’10s blog days were anddeclaresthe ultimate ambient Americana record to beJames Ferraro’s gas-station reverieLast American Hero.\nOnI’ll Be Waving as You Drive Away, Pedigo drops the smirk. Played with a powerful directness and dappled with rich arrangements, it’s his most majestic album yet, though he doesn’t accomplish it through epic, galloping melodies the wayWilliam Tylermight, nor through rugged textural exploration asDaniel Bachmanwould. Because Pedigo is concerned, above all, with the beauty in emptiness itself. “Even the flatness I love,” he’s said of his hometown of Amarillo—a muse that he defends in interviews as if it were a frowned-upon lover. “It makes you breathe a little bit better when you feel like you can see that far.”\nPedigo’s music, in turn, breathes. Building on the quiet, unflashy melancholy of 2021’sLetting Goand 2023’sThe Happiest Times I Ever Ignored, his playing doesn’t aim for the jaw-dropping splendor of the Grand Canyon, but the small pit stop towns on the drive up. Striking an airy grace halfway between ECM and Windham Hill, Pedigo and producerScott Hirsch’s arrangements are designed to create a sense of space. Piano notes trickle down the descending melody of “All the Way Across” like falling helicopter seeds, while vibraphone-like keys swirl around circular arpeggios on “Hermes,” dissolving the track into a liquid wash of color. Pedigo and Hirsch leave plenty of room for the little details to shine through, materializing as gradually as flecks of landscape passing in the window."

    "review_text": "Felix Manuel, the DJ and producer better known asDjrum, has a way with sleights of hand. In aninterviewwith Resident Advisor, he explained some of his favorite mixing techniques. One is using an ambient record to stage a dramatic shift in energy. Another is the crab, an old-school hip-hop trick where you use your thumb and three fingers to tickle the crossfader, teasing the next record in tiny, rapid-fire slivers. Moves like these allow Manuel, armed with nothing more than a bag of records, a mixer, and three turntables (set upbattle style), to nimbly move through dubstep, drum’n’bass, breakcore, house, techno, hip-hop, trip-hop, drone, jazz, soul, classical, gabber, whatever—all in one set. Jump to any point in his recentBBC essential mix, which blitzes through 62 records in two hours, and you’ll get the idea. Has anyone else ever scratchedArthur Russell’s voice over galloping kick drums?\nUnder Tangled Silence, Manuel’s third album, pulls off a similar feat, but to subtler, more poetic effect. Like his DJ sets, it draws from all corners of his musical universe, channeling his classical piano training as much as his life-changing moments at London squat raves. But unlike the rowdy melee of his DJing,Under Tangled Silencedistills these sounds into something fluid, seamless, and technically virtuosic. His rhythmic finesse drives most of the album, but this isn’t exactly a dance record; it’s a mercurial survey of what sound like Manuel’s deepest emotions, delivered with a level of nuance that’s rare in club music.\nAt the heart of the album is a deft synthesis of wholly different musical traditions. Manuel has played piano since the age of seven, but only gradually wove the instrument into his records. In 2016, he told aninterviewerthat the piano parts on hisForgettingEP had been “very much composed rather than improvised,” adding that improvisation had “yet to filter its way into my production properly.” Here, piano is the album’s lead instrument, much of it seemingly off the cuff. (Manuel says that “Waxcap,” the album’s second track, began as a jazzy improv he later developed further.)\nThere are other live instruments, too. Manuel plays harp, percussion, and mbira, and calls in past collaborator Zosia Jagodzinska for silky swoops of cello. But the melding of jazz, classical and dance music runs deeper than instrumentation, right down to the arrangements, both in individual songs and across the album as a whole. While most dance music works in phrases of eight or 16 bars, luring the listener into a hypnotic groove,Under Tangled Silencerarely repeats itself for more than a few measures at a time. Sloping and swerving, dipping and soaring, Manuel’s compositions move like a murmuration of birds."

    "review_text": "Like a feather in the wind or the global stock market, all of us are subject to stochastic drift. Originating in advanced statistics, the term refers to the way in which randomness works upon a system, how the trajectory of a line sways as it’s affected by unanticipated events. For SamBarker, the metaphor of a winding path has been meaningful in recent years.\nAfter an extended period as a label runner and concert booker, the Berlin-based musician entered the spotlight with 2018’sDebiasingEP and 2019’sUtility, two records that articulated a weightless, kick-drumless vision of techno. What should have been a dizzying ascent was cut short by the pandemic: tour cancelled, label shuttered, and hard-won contacts with booking agents broken off. At his lowest moment, the artist filled out paperwork at a job center and weighed leaving the music industry behind. “It was quite remarkable how the rug could be pulled from everything in such an all-encompassing way,” he reflected in an interview withTone Glow. “This made it quite hard to engage in a rule-based or goal-based approach because it seemed like every goal was changing from one week to the next.”\nBarker’s second LP,Stochastic Drift, is both a synthesis of his wilderness years and a thrilling inflection point. In a field of brilliantambienttechnoproducers, he’s delivered his most dazzling and definitive statement to date. The strict parameters that guided his early records’ zero-gravity rush have dissolved into freeform experimentation, allowing his tracks to billow and burst as the mood demands. Across the album, Barker blurs analog and mechanized instruments into gauzy clouds, jazzy ambiance, and elegant percussion. He navigates extremes, toggling between aural chaos and hyper-mediated technology by harnessing randomness for all its power.\nOn early solo releases, Barker committed himself to restricting his own talent with an intensity that would makeBrian Enoblush. In interviews, he could occasionally sound like a level-headed startup founder, phrasing his ideas in terms of inputs and outputs and making a cool yet impassioned case for techno disruption. The difference was that Barker was concerned with scrambling expectations rather than optimizing outcomes. Taking inspiration from engineering, probability theory, and social psychology (and titling most tracks after related concepts), he set applied sciences to a dancefloor pulse. The continually cresting trance of “Hedonic Treadmill” or “When Prophecy Fails” was a product of limitation, ingeniously making up for the tracks’ lack of thump with pillowy texture, glassy melodies, and ceaseless forward motion."

    "review_text": "LISAwants you to believe she’s multifaceted. The Thai singer and rapper’s debut solo album is calledAlter Ego, and if one takes her at her word, these 13 songs are meant to live up to that title. She presents different versions of herself, among them Vixi, a villain who drinks your tears; Roxi, a rock star who loves energy drinks; and Sunni, a girl who’s afraid of the dark. If this sounds a bit hollow, it’s because the concept is designed to sell multiple copies of the same album (CDs can be purchased with one of five photo books, each featuring one of the identities). This marketing ploy also highlights her biggest challenge: LISA, who is part of the record-setting K-pop girl groupBLACKPINK, needs to convince you that she has depth without her bandmates.Alter Egoproves she doesn’t.\nAt this point in her career, LISA is too big to fail commercially but also too big to succeed creatively. When BLACKPINK was gaining international acclaim, they followed theBTSmodel of crossover appeal: Theycollaboratedwith Western artists, sang morein English, andavoided the genre-blendingthat makes K-pop a fascinating game of connect-the-dots. One of the group’s debut singles, “Whistle,” was a beguiling mixture ofDipset-ismsand country music. “As If It’s Your Last,” from 2017, was like “Pon de Floor” fused with ’80s mall pop (inexplicably, there was country in this track, too).Alter Ego, like much of BLACKPINK’s recent material, doesn’t try anything as audacious. Take the album’s bookends: “Born Again” is a banal disco track in the vein ofDua Lipa, but it fails to understand how a voice can be a vessel for exultant uplift. “Dream” is a shallow ballad that can’t help but feel flimsy, rushing through lines to eschew any meaningful pathos.\nThe problem is that LISA’s role in BLACKPINK is to offer moments of snotty charm—her range may be limited, but it has a purpose. When she’s tasked with carrying a track, the songs are tedious. She channels second-rateCardi Bon “Fxck Up the World,” but it’s not untilFuturearrives—with a phoned-in verse, no less—that we hear any personality. The features on this album often have this effect. “Rapunzel” is too sedate, but hearingMegan Thee Stallion’s “Ah!” reveals that thereareways to take a cutesy song and make it playful, bratty, and cocksure. Most damning isRosalíaon “New Woman.” Hearing her glide in Spanish makes glaringly obvious that LISA should’ve explored the phonological possibilities—andpersonalities—of other languages. Even her role inThe White Lotus, where she speaks in Thai, makes this project feel stifled by comparison.\nIfAlter Egopresents LISA as the most generic embodiment of a pop star, then it is no surprise that its best songs rely on tried-and-true formulas. “Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me)” takes the Sixpence None the Richersongand ramps up the sensuality: the couple is in Paris, there’s a lot more kissing, and LISA sings of her lover’s tongue doing tricks. It works because the original hook is so indelible—all its tenderness is already understood, so hearing it collapse into dreamy eroticism feels apropos. These highlights, though, aren’t so much good as acceptable. The syncopated percussion on theTylacollaboration “When I’m With You” is a welcome change of pace; it may be worse than everything onTyla, but at least it’s seductive. “Rockstar” is the closest thing here to “traditional” K-pop, but the adventurousness only goes as far as a glossy chorus reminiscent ofTame Impala-producedTravis Scott. One line on “Fxck Up the World” manages to summarize the whole experience: “They want the old LISA, then listen to my old shit.” It’s hard to imagine who wouldn’t.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "The wildest internet rap scenes of the last few years, from the head-scrambling shudders of rage to plugg’s heavenly glide, have largely been dominated by Americans. But that’s starting to change thanks to a zany crop of Brits mangling and remaking these subgenres. YT andLancey Foux’s “Black & Tan,” a contender for song of the summer ’24, crams in so much convulsive percussion you almost miss the rappers’ dignified English accents. They brag about how they can make crowds explode in Miami, Tennessee, or Surrey Quays over an Ambezza beat clearly inspired by jerk (aka Milwaukee lowend). A few MCs lead this wave, among them Lancey,Fimiguerrero, andLen. And rather than trample each other to the top, these three artists have combined forces to create a new narrative. Their debut collab tape,CONGLOMERATE, rings out like a war cry: Don’t fuck with the UK underground.\nOf the three, Lancey has the supreme reputation, collaborating with stars likeYeatandSexyy Redand palling around withKanye. He practically spawned a new microgenre (“dream rage”?) by coating the subgenre’s cybernetic steel with psychedelic glitter. But the hottest right now is the Nigeria-born Fimiguerrero, who’s coming off a relentless run of TikTok hits and the eclectic hyper-jerk of his albumNew World Order.Raisedin the hood in Stockwell, Len is the least renowned member of the trio, but maybe the most tonally tantalizing. His spectral melodies thrill on album highlight “Excuse My French,” whose bejeweled bass smacks like OsamaSon moshpit rap for posh Kensington kids.\nThroughoutCONGLOMERATE, the trio foils each other in hypnotic ways. Fimi hits the rawest, with barely any Auto-Tune or reverb, just locked-in, clenched-fist flows. He delivers flexes with such forceful phrasing that every word pops: “I get paid in euro, dollar, peso, even yen,” he boasts on “Excuse My French,” spacing each syllable perfectly in the pocket. “I didn't die trying getting rich, like 50 Cent.” Constantly cloaked in smoke, floating across the mix like a phantom, Len thirsts after hotties amid the lightfoot skitter of “After Life” and confesses his rap dreams to his disapproving mum on “Ozempic,” the album’s prettiest song. The slickest but most inconsistent is Lancey, who only appears on six of the album’s 13 main tracks (plus one of the three songs on the album’s deluxe version). His naturally emotive tone makes him sound slightly devious, like he’s the dark horse hiding behind his homies waiting to attack—or to deliver a spontaneous absurd image, like “too burnt, I'm filled with cheese, a nigga be splurgin' out” that makes you picture Lancey as a human toastie."

    "review_text": "Listening toPerila’s album on headphones at a coffee shop, I heard the faint sound of a trumpet. I was about halfway through the track “Mola,” which sounds like a field recording of footsteps on a wet forest floor. The trumpet, I thought, was an interesting choice, the brass moan an effective contrast to Perila’s rumbling, ambient gloom.\nUntil I paused the music and the trumpet was still there. The coffee shop was playing jazz through their speakers. Then I pushed play and in a dark whoosh, Perila’s song faded out and, with another dark whoosh, the next one began. In the background, the trumpet tooted away.\nThis is not a bad thing. Perila, the abstract music project of Alexandra Zakharenko, a Russian artist now based in Germany, is not a muscular endeavor. That the outside might seep into her hushed soundscapes is inevitable. It may even be the point. Listening to the outside world was John Cage’s whole deal. On YouTube, you can watch avideoof Pauline Oliveros, purveyor of deep listening, playing her accordion in “duet” with a barking dog.\nAcross multiple albums and collaborations, Perila has invented a way of performing where moments that feel incidental are tightly composed. At her best, her music feels buoyant and brash, heartrending and exciting. On her new albumIntrinsic Rhythm, there are some of those moments.\nIntrinsic Rhythmis a long album: 21 tracks and just over an hour. The music, more a collection of ideas than songs, often feels like imitations of field recordings more than field recordings themselves—though there are, of course, snatches of birdsong. As they blend with Perila’s production, they become snapshots of dreamlife. Or nightmare life. Depending on how you want to think about it. “Sepula Purm” sounds like a fire in the winter wind or a stethoscope on a gassy stomach. “Nim Aliev” sounds like a dial tone (is it a dial tone?) that fades out slowly. The little rumblings on “Air Two Air” sounds like mouse Morse code, the rippling parts like if a diamond could play synthesizer. All of these instrumental moments blend together, ephemeral.\nBetter are the pieces where Zakharenko uses her voice. I’d say “sings,” but that’s not always accurate. Sometimes she does sing, other times she hums, whispers, speaks. On “Darbouse Song,” my favorite track onIntrinsic Rhythm, she sings to herself. The recording quality is particularly low. You can hear footsteps in the background. It sounds like she accidentally recorded a voice note of herself mindlessly singing while on a hike. It’s a lovely moment, intimate and human. It feels like you’re walking beside her. She seems like good company."

    "review_text": "The growing pains of late adolescence can be conflicting. Do you remember that deep yearning for cheap thrills and total autonomy? For the freedom to fall flat on your face? This is whatLeaving Homemeans toFearDorian: growing up so quickly you forget you’re also mourning your loss of innocence. “It’sLeaving Homein the sense of how you were raised, the routines you’re used to, your mentality,” he said ina recent interview. “I’m breaking away from those things and becoming my own person.” The 18-year-old rapper-producer has made a lot of moves in the past year: aself-titled debut, ajubilant full-lengthwithPolo PerksandAyooLii, a low-key EP withBy Storm’sRiTchie. He’s also spent time away from his hometown of Atlanta, performing in New York bars and Milwaukee clubs,wandering in Dublinandriding around London. The result is his second solo album,Leaving Home,which recounts angst and triumph through claustrophobic beats and diaristic deadpan. After years of turning obscure samples intoearcandyfor other rappers, FearDorian crafts something more insular to make sense of his own growth.\nIf the songwriting makes one thing clear, it’s that Dorian is still settling into his skin. Every boastful step forward is offset by future uncertainty. On “Gotta Be,” as his sandpaper melody passes through wistful streams of synthesizer, FearDorian fixates on mortality. If he weren’t cut off byKlein’s processed vocals, the lilt at the end of his verse could’ve rendered the track a delicate, sullen lullaby: “This shit get so real, I be fightin’ for my life … I done fucked up so many times tryna get it right.” Like any teenager would, he relishes getting paid to go overseas and see his face on flyers. On “I.V.,” he pokes fun at the Rick Owens kicks he’s buying for his sister. But he can’t help but probe beneath this shiny exterior. In an ode toEarl Sweatshirtlater on, Dorian reprises asamplefromFeet of Clayand reworks the desolate refrain from “Shattered Dreams”: “They ain’t say I could leave/They ain’t say I was bleeding,” he spits over Jersey club percussion. His vulnerability is at the forefront, but he’s never sounded this confident as a rapper before.\nIf it weren’t for the pulsating, head-knocking rhythms,Leaving Homewould feel considerably more forlorn. The record starts out pretty brightly: “In Turn For?” kicks it off with elastic 808s over lambent dream pop, and the one-two punch of “Aspen” and “Every Time” feels like hitting a slipstream onMario Kart. These lighthearted textures reflect the childlike wonder of visiting landmarks you’d only seen on TV growing up; despite Dorian’s internal tug-of-war, he’s trying to enjoy the moment. When that giddy feeling fades, some of the grimiest production in his catalog rises to the top: The thumping kick drums of “Floor Tom” turn a post-punk loop into a speaker knocker, “Las Vegas” flips a dreamyCocteau Twinsstaple into something sludgy, and standouts “I.V.” and “Gotta Be” are equal parts bleak and intoxicating.\nAt FearDorian’s Brooklyn listening party the night ofLeaving Home’s release, I stood at the back of the crowd, watching as the faces featured on the record joined him onstage:quinn, Polo Perks, Klein, RiTchie. In a live setting, it doesn’t sound like music by a kid who’s at odds with himself; Dorian is raucous and exuberant. He’s hittingLil Uzieyerolls and spitting every bar, even diving into outstretched arms when Polo grabs a mic for “Floor Tom.” On record, “Not Just Yet” with RiTchie is chilling—the type of song you nod along to screw-faced in solitude—but pouring from the speakers, it feels like something you could dance to. Even when Dorian’s lyrics mourn a failed relationship, the energy in the room is rejoiceful. The contrasts breathe life intoLeaving Home: excitement in the face of dread, optimism shielded by regret, shadows looming over greener pastures. This is what it’s like to grapple with adulthood."

    "review_text": "Underground rap heads either loveLAZER DIM 700’s serrated freestyles or say he epitomizes the genre’s deterioration into clickbait meme music. The Atlantan was the most abrasive rookie of 2024, toting a style midway between zoinked party music and air-raid sirens. He spits in an extremes-of-consciousness flow, cracking songs open with a torrent of expletives before launching into verses that are basically just one long, leapfrogging hook, like he’s trying to speedrun to the two-minute mark. It’s a world ofza,zot,fawks,fine shyts,wiggingandwigan out,buckshots,buck-downs, andbust-downs. He records everything on the phone app BandLab, so the mixing is nonexistent.\nBut underneath the viral spectacle is just a young man from the small town of Cordele, Georgia, who idolizedLil Wayneas a kid and got into making rap in the second grade, when his mother’s boyfriend would set up makeshift studios in their house. LAZER DIM 700’s entire come-up has been serendipitous: He met his early producer-partner Goxan in the comment section of a YouTube type beat; he created his first viral hit, “Asian rock,” on PlaqueBoyMax’s Twitch streamSong Wars, over a random beat he found on YouTube. His best songs catch lightning in a vial, 90-second snippets of comedy and chaos rooted in ephemeral, absurdist moments. They electrify but also make you wonder how different they might sound if he’d recorded them at another time, with other arbitrary thoughts swirling in his scrambled brain.\nKEEPIN IT CLOUDYcould soundtrack a haunted hayride where a distorted dark-plugg 808 effect shadows every scare, the actors are costumed like “Swiss cheese” opps, and weed smoke casts an impenetrable pall. This is LAZER’s debut studio album, which would suggest a level up: more time spent, higher production values. But instead of thrashing out to new ground, the album mostly sounds like LAZER on cruise control—and it loses some of the janky insanity that made his early music so thrilling.\nYou can blame some of that dulled spark on the cleaner mixing, which takes away the earlier music’s scrappy, sickly thrill, when the songs felt perpetually on the verge of collapse. But it’s also because LAZER’s voice has a sedate, weathered edge, like he recorded the album after running a mile personal best. To quote “KEEPIN IT CLOUDY,” he often sounds like the za has sent him into orbit. Goxan and Skellocam’s bass spasms like it’s speaking in vibrational braille on “MILITANT,” practically swallowing up LAZER’s arrhythmic flow. “FAST & FURIOUS” smacks like any number of dark plugg tunes from the last couple of years; LAZER soft-talks like he’s trying to calm Ark and mahxlxtl’s beat down from a temper tantrum."

    "review_text": "Imagine a world whereupsammy’s music is pumped into nurseries and kindergartens, shaping children from birth. It’d be a world without wars, where kindness reigned and malice was snuffed in the cradle. Dutch artist Thessa Torsing’s tunes are practically the inverse of the abrasive, perpetually stimulating, highly synthetic music that typically thrives in the electronic scene today. She’s worked with a number of prestigious labels and venues—from Unsound and Panorama Bar to Dekmantel and PAN, including a formative residency at Amsterdam’s De School. As her profile has risen, her music has only gotten looser and lighter, a Gaussian blur of IDM and moonlit ambient. Exquisite real-world samples, like slowed-down rustling leaves, litter her musical petri dishes. A student of landscape architecture, she hasspokenabout the ways that she conceptualizes her music in similar terms, with layers of sound in place of bedrock, soil, flora and fauna, and human-built structures.\nEverything aboutStrange Meridiansfeels organic, from the raw samples and childlike swirl to the packaging. The record was pressed on 180 grams of bio-vinyl and comes with a poem Torsing wrote that seems to obliquely reference a lost or damaged relationship. “You talk back/but I can’t hear you/something springs forth/somewhere/a remnant that remains,” the poem ends. The eight tracks don’t offer any clues about what story is unfolding, but maybe these are the remnants—the barely-there plot points of a personal odyssey.\nThe album’s mostly drumless sound is woven out of calming twinkles and soft drones that resemble anthropomorphic ocarinas yawning in the twilight. The effect is like floating along a lazy river flanked by a fairytale forest of red lanterns and carefree animal gatherings. It’s the kind of music that fills my brain with made-up gibberish, words that grope feebly toward capturing the music’s elusive textures and atmospheres—heaven oak,frogswath symphony,swishing nucleus,crustacean whisker. The hectic feel of upsammy’s earlier tracks—the chime-churn of “It Drips,” the hiccuping chaos of “Constructing”—is nowhere to be found. Where her earlier music could resemble a butterfly, shimmering with color and quivering rhythms,Strange Meridiansis a kind of reverse metamorphosis, enveloping the artist in a cocoon of cozy stillness.\nTrack titles reflect the shift toward serenity: “Aqualizing,” “Cosmo,” “Edge of Sleep.” They say,It’s okay to lose focus—this is music for theinattentioneconomy, lullabies guiding you to radiant dreaming. These tender songs’ drowsiness is never dreary. The womblike drift of “Cosmo” reminds me ofLegend of Zeldaopen-world exploration themes, or video-game pause-screen music—subdued, to signal a break in the action, yet so entrancing that you might stop the game just to hear the soundtrack. Torsing has a knack for tension and spacing, letting low-key synths steal the spotlight, before gradually introducing more sounds and petering others out. “Edge of Sleep” unfurls like the most Xanax-relaxed orchestra ever, each sound softly passing the baton to another, then curtsying away. It’s lovely to bed-rot in these worlds, squinting your ears to hear the whispered language in “Mazing” or letting the oozing ASMR slime and stippling kicks of “Spiral Biting Its Tail” caress your brain."

    "review_text": "Lucy Railton’s new albumBlue Veilisolates the moment when a cello’s bow makes contact with the strings and presents it as a miniature Big Bang, a crucible of tension and friction that burns fiercely on a level that’s too small to see. In afascinating interviewwith German writer Stephan Kunze, the UK composer and cellist described the experience of playing her instrument as like “standing next to a guitar amp,” andBlue Veildoes everything it can to make you feel the vibrations short of grabbing your face and pressing it up against the strings.\nThough Railton found a nice old Paris church in which to record these seven pieces, we don’t hear any of the space in the music. Rather, she distills some sort of platonic ideal of cello-ness. You get an acute sense of the instrument as a machine, yet it’s seemingly stripped of its constituent parts: no wood, no wire, no horsehair, just a deadly and wicked thrum. You feel like you’re inside the instrument, or maybe like you’ve shrunk down to ant size and are running along one of the strings as the bow bears down on you. The music sounds like a slumbering beast at times, breathing with each stroke, betraying its human source even when the eerie just-intonation overtones start to sound like theremins or outer-space rumblings.\nThis is Railton’s first solo cello album, but she’s been a regular presence in the classical avant-garde for a while, organizing a long-running concert series at London’s Café Oto and co-founding the London Contemporary Music Festival in between gigs with the likes ofBat for LashesandBonobo, andBach recordings on ECM. She might be best-known for her work withKali Malone, who co-producedBlue VeilwithStephen O’Malley. The same trio recorded the awesome pandemic-era drone albumDoes Spring Hide Its Joy, which seems pulled from the same inky depths as the music onBlue Veil; both records use barely audible sine waves to heighten the low end, contributing to the feeling of the music seeping into your bones that Railton must feel as she plays her mighty instrument.\nIn a sense,Blue Veilputs you in the driver’s seat, breaking the polite distance between player and listener that usually manifests in the sense of space Railton rejects here. She uses subtle electronic sine waves not as an embellishment but to bring out qualities within the cello itself, namely the physicality of her experience of playing it. There are times when the timbre of the cello sounds hyperreal, almost like a computer preset; Railton displays little dynamic range as she patiently, almost surgically traces the edges of cool minor chords and discordant clusters. If you were to illustrateBlue Veil, it would look like seven streaks of black ink, or maybe seven slashes in a canvas from a very large knife."

    "review_text": "On a surface level—with the words tuned out, free of context—you might mistake Nap Eyes’The Neon Gatefor polite, normie music. The songs are inoffensive and breezy at first glance, melodic and winsome. They could easily blend into the background at a coffee shop, lost behind the whir of an espresso machine. There’s very little that reads “neon” about Halifax quartet’s fifth record from the outset. But beneath their algorithm-friendly strums, the songs onThe Neon Gatesearch for the transcendent and otherworldly. Taking inspiration from Yeats and Pushkin poems alongside the natural world, Nap Eyes finds the phantasmagorical in the familiar, like a psychedelic Comp Lit syllabus that turns the known world on its head.\nOpener “Eight Tired Starlings” is a sedate and meditative kick-off featuring gently picked guitar and singer Nigel Chapman’s conversational description of birds against the grand scale of the universe. “Oh ain’t it really crazy, the way this world’s so, so, so/So fine and strange?/So weird, all across the distant range” is a dubious lyrical start, stoner thoughts put to music. But things get cooking a couple of tracks later on “Demons,” a Pushkin adaptation that unfolds like a fever dream. It’s a charming ballad whose sunny, tinkling keys amplify its discomfiting lyrics the same way the moon illuminates the “total darkness” at the song’s opening. No one’s ever sounded so unbothered as Chapman as he describes the way demons “with their plaintive howls and shrieking … pounce upon my heart, and rend.” It’s a synchronization between form and function, a sound that shrugs at dread.\n“Passageway” similarly straddles the natural and supernatural, a ’90sMazzy Starstrummer that toggles between a Medieval vision (“Through a peasant’s eyes I saw a green-clad man/ringing blue bells of offering”) and the mundane present, where “people talk on phones and they drive down roads/to places many miles away.” Blue doorways appear where mirrors should be; there are mysterious walks down crystal pathways; the narrator listens to the Goo Goo Dolls’ “Iris” at 9 a.m. and tries, unsuccessfully, to rechannel the divine. It’s an amusing and effective fusion of the imaginary and its opposite, the vast gulf in meaning between an epic journey and a Monday morning.\nThe best songs here are warmed and colored by instrumental flourishes, as with the bright guitar and piano notes on “Demons” or the opening electric noodle of “Tangent Dissolve.” These are beautifully mastered, nestling Chapman’sStephen Malkmus-style half-singing between rich guitar tones, restrained-yet-reverberant drum beats, and intricate layers of melody. Yeats adaptation and album highlight “I See Phantoms of Hatred and of the Heart’s Fullness and of the Coming Emptiness” evokes a less-loucheDan Bejar, a lush groove backing the tale of Yeats’ “monstrous familiar images” that “swim to the mind’s eye,” punctuated by the hiss of a cymbal.\nThe album’s weakest moments come when the band leans on contemplative vibes without evoking any whiff of danger or hallucination. The bright plinking synthesizer notes of “Feline Wave Race” sound like YouTube bumper music, and its fumbling lyrics weigh it further down—“Beyond all doubt/beyond all trace/beyond all trace of doubt/in outer space,” Chapman sings earnestly, open mic profundity about which he seems entirely unselfconscious.\nWhat to make of a world where you can be surrounded by celestial marvels one minute and traffic the next? This question sits at the heart ofThe Neon Gate, which is full of portals (like the one in “Passageway”) that can’t be uncrossed. There’s so much beauty, and so much terror—there are pouncing demons, but there is also poetry and technicolor dreams. Nap Eyes never presents a definite answer to this psychedelic quandary, opting instead to amble along at a steady BPM and document the great mystery for the coffee shop crowd.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Central Cee’s ascent over the past five years has been staggering, even by the accelerated standards of TikTok stardom. He arrived on the scene in 2020, and, aided by an acute sense of timing, he’s successfully ridden UK drill’s predictable arc from folk devil soundtrack to mainstream chart mainstay. He’s had theDrakeco-sign, the buzzy clutch of mixtapes, a viral hit with the cheeky “Doja.” His 2023 collaboration withDave, “Sprinter,” spent an unprecedented 10 weeks at the top of the UK singles chart. Whichever your preferred streaming platform or social media service, he’s ensured those all-important numbers are ticking endlessly up.\nThis has positioned Cench, as he’s known, as the ubiquitous new face of the UK’s rap scene, for those both watching at home andlooking in from abroad. He’s one of the very few (perhaps only) rappers from the UK whose voice you’ll hear booming out of car windows in cities around the U.S. This has not happened by accident. He raps with a distinctive clarity, and his flow resembles rote classroom exercises—asmart, viral takeon the slang-translation rap trope when he debuted on L.A. Leakers in 2022 helped too. Last year, heexplained to theGuardianhow he engineers his lyrics to make them more digestible for American audiences. WithCan’t Rush Greatness, his first album since signing with Columbia, he wants to stake his claim to generational-talent status.\nUnfortunately, the most interesting thing about Central Cee is not his risk-averse music, but rather how he markets himself. He raps a lot about this. About his steely negotiation skills, and about those numbers he puts up. It’s mogul rap, only withoutJay-Z’s charismatic finesse; lifestyle rap withoutYoung Thug’s comical excess. And while the UK’s millennial icons likeStormzyand Dave have put message over money (while still stacking plenty of the latter), the UK’s Gen Z rap acolytes are here for what they’re owed and not shy about it. Central Cee gives a cut-glass voice to this cause. It reflects a vogueish kind of dead-eyed capitalism that shares the territory of podcasts likeDiary of a CEO, where entrepreneurs talk about the sacrifices they’ve made and the mental health struggles they’ve endured in pursuit of money.\nIt is market-optimized music, growth-hack rap. “I won’t even lie,” Cench raps on “Limitless,” with a sliver of remorse that he knows his fans will forgive him for, “I put my family second, I’m sorry, the money’s my main concern.” The accompanying video runs like a promo for a UFC bout: Cench hanging out in a big house in the hills with his boys, eschewing everyday luxuries for late-night runs, flinging his skinny frame through calisthenics workouts, and spitting bars from inside a hypobaric chamber. On closer “Don’t Know Anymore” Cench measures his faith in music by how many views his videos get. Tracks like the torn “Must Be” go nowhere. It's polished to the point of being stilted."

    "review_text": "London-based lo-fi electronic musicianLeo Bhanjihas saidthat he feels successful as a songwriter when he’s able to express confusion in his work. His songs eschew causality and linear narrative for vibrant pastiches of half-revealed secrets, flickers of regret, and inner monologues. On his new EP,Shell, he deftly uses this oblique approach to relay the turmoil he feels as he falls in love, often despite his own best intentions.\nBy weaving together past, present, and future, Bhanji cultivates a sense of purposeful chaos. He begins the gentle guitar ballad “Hazel & Deadnettle” looking forward to a love interest’s arrival, then ruminates on a night in the past when their relationship likely ended. The song closes with a blurry, mysterious image that similarly evokes both present and past: “See your picture way after it’s gone, it’s burning.” On “Lung,” he claims that he doesn’t want to fall in love, but the glinting blips of synth betray the anticipation and intrigue of a forthcoming romance. Like light through glass, these stories, warped through the prism of time, fracture into keen observations, eager dreams, and nostalgic memories.\nShell’s opaque lyrics are made even more so by Bhanji’s loose, gravely vocals. His words melt together and bleed into the watery production. A handful of phrases in each song function like auditory Rorschachs, jumping out of the soup of imagery to come into sudden focus. The effect can add an interesting texture and meta-narrative: On “The Invisibles,” the phrase “I’ll end up falling in love again” lingers, imbuing the song with a poignant mix of sadness and hope. But when a prominent phrase is even a little bit mundane, it can make the whole song feel platitudinal. On “Dance W U,” Bhanji repeats the phrase “You know I’ll leave any party for you” a handful of times. It’s an uninspiring promise that rings hollow.\nRather than producing his own music as he often has in the past, Bhanji worked with producer Felix Joseph (AJ Tracey,Jorja Smith) onShell. Bhanjicredits Josephwith keeping his music more focused. The songs, though sparse and streamlined, don’t quite achieve the propulsiveness of Bhanji’s best work. On “Damaged,” from his 2021 EPBirth Videos, a gossamer choral sample collided with an unrelenting beat that then buoyed a sped-up and distorted vocal outro. Poetic ruminations were punctuated with candid group-chat wisdom: “I sleep with my eyes open, dream the black around my lids” was followed by, “Everyone’s heart freaks me out.”\nComparatively, the songwriting onShellis less astute and deliberate, the meandering observations less rich in insight. And while the delicate wash of synth and guitar work is lovely, it feels more subdued and less exploratory. Bhanji’s music is most compelling when he relays dispatches from a mind that’s processing, reminiscing, yearning, and anticipating all at once, without losing sight of how he feels about it. There’s a real vulnerability in allowing you to witness the world alongside him: to sense its little pleasures and beguiling contradictions in real time, together."

    "review_text": "Love bites, andYunè Pinkuknows it. “Still hurts to blush,” the Irish-via-South London electro-pop producer sings on her 2023 EPBabylon IX, distilling all the pain points of infatuation—embarrassment, unrequited feelings, the knowledge that you’re at someone else’s mercy—into four simple words. Then she gives the disturbing kicker: “It still heals to cut.” Before pressing play on her new project,Scarlet Lamb, a listener is confronted with the image of two young sheep, slaughtered and arranged on an ornate silver dish. Off to the side appears to be a ceremonial blade that, one imagines, might be employed in some sort of Celtic pagan ritual. The six songs within find Yunè cutting deeper, embracing a darkness that adds new contours and a confident sense of control to her songwriting and production.\nIt doesn’t take long for the titular animals to reappear onScarlet Lamb. Opening track “Midnight Oil” finds Yunè delivering a barely-sensical collage of bloodied lambs, seashells and salt licks, zephyr hands and rubber bands over a trip-hop-inflected house beat. Still, a few lines stick out for their relative directness: “Where is the recipe to being what I always need?” she inquires “Where is the heart in me?” Knowing Yunè wrote the song about recovering from burnout by connecting with nature lends some coherence to the lyrics’ frenzied imagery. But she doesn't let you see her sweat; at the song’s bridge, Yunè strips away the haze, cranks up the bass, and slips into a pitched-down, sprechstimme register. For eight bars, the twilight beach glitches into a catwalk, strobe lights slicing through the gloom.\nHowever, whenScarlet Lamb’s production falters, the cracks in its writing start to show. On the more stripped-down “Concorde,” Yunè sings “it’s you who colors me blue,” but she’s not touchingLana Del Rey’s delivery of practically the same line. Even the song’s central metaphor has beendone betterin recent years. With its bouncy keyboards buried in misty synth washes, “Half Alive” is the most akin to Yunè’s inspired earlier work; put the words on a page, though, and they’re all platitude, lacking the guts and viscera that made a track like “Blush Cut” so compelling. “Don’t Stop,” meanwhile, is filled with ear-catching instrumental flourishes—glimmers of electric guitar feedback, a distorted vocoder breakdown—yet its inert melody leaves the song less of a richly textured inky black, and more like a muted grey. As another portrait of artistic fatigue, it works—but almost too well.\nHaving plumbed the wells of UK garage and techno on previous releases, Yunè continues to be at her most creatively fruitful when looking backwards. Here, she taps into the sounds of her native Ireland. “Reckless Sensation,” perhapsScarlet Lamb’s best song, imagines an alternate ’90s whereThe Cranberries’ Dolores O’Riordan sang onMassive Attack’s “Teardrop.” While other artists have experimented with a similar palette, to varying degrees of success (the good:Caroline Polachek’scover of“Breathless” and the bagpipe solo on “Blood and Butter”; the bad: Rina Sawayama’s underwhelming, Corrs-inspired “Catch Me in the Air”) Yunè’s totally at home against a backdrop of shuffling drums and—for the first time on a Yunè Pinku song—gently strummed acoustic guitar. It’s neither a nightmare nor a reverie; rather, she’s managed to mimic the blissful oblivion of a totally dreamless sleep. Maybe that’s where the real comfort lies."

    "review_text": "When sound systems in West Bengal start playing music, the bass is so powerful that pooled water appears tosizzle like oil. Smartphonefootageof the contraptions in action sometimes appears distorted from the force of the sound waves. The sound systems are made of brightly colored speakers and amps,originally meantfor religious ceremonies or political gatherings, that have been tied together into mobile structures that loom two or three stories high. These systems, or “boxes,” are the centerpiece of “soundcheck” battles, where the most powerful sound system wins. They’re exciting but overwhelming affairs in which the sheer volume of the music threatens to destroy the apparatus broadcasting it.\nThese behemoth, screaming structures captivated Brooklyn-based electronic musicians Baalti when they were working on their new EP,Mela, which means “festival” in Hindi. Their previous EP, 2023’sBetter Together,was a set of melodic club tracks that foregrounded vocal samples from Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi songs. But while studyingdek bass, the music made for West Bengal sound systems, the extremity and physicality of the sound compelled them.\nWhile working onMela,Baalti focused less on melody or narrative. Instead, the four songs on their new EP feel both sculptural and kinetic, like a conveyor belt of molten glass being blown into glistening, abstract shapes in double time. Vocal samples are spliced and sped into blips that uncoil like slinkies. Basslines stretch out into bellowing groans, and drum beats hurtle across the mix like racehorses. It’s the most compelling project Baalti have made yet—a rowdy, celebratory collection of UK bass tracks that channel the intensity of the soundcheck battle into a never-ending party.\nMuch of the sound design tiesMela’s tracks to their Indian festival origins. Throughout the EP, Baalti foreground dhol percussion—a double-headed folk drum typical in North Indian outdoor celebrations. On “Overbit,” the dhol’s rattling triplet rhythm sets the song in motion. A sound system bass is layered with a pulse that thumps like a heartbeat, a pirouetting vocal sample, and a chirping synth, establishing a flow that’s as hectic as it is propulsive. Later, slippery synth droplets are interrupted by what sound like metal sticks banging clumsily. It’s an unexpected but intriguing interruption, like a friend knocking at your door at midnight to present you with a bouquet of flowers.\nThe triplet-driven “Loose Leaf” splices inaudiofrom a video of someone hyping up the DJ in a small-scale soundcheck. The vocal sample is buoyed by a glitzy mix of laser synthssimilar tothe ones you might find on a DJ Dinu track, a gurgling bassline, and more dhol. They also make ample use of field recordings from the region; the references to West Bengal give the music a grounding sense of physicality, no matter how frenzied it gets."

    "review_text": "In October 2024, Haley Fohr, under herCircuit des Yeuxmoniker, released “God Dick,” an overwhelming barrage of texture accompanied by lyrics invoking the phallic divine. Dissonant strings balloon, giving way to colossal synthesizers, frantic programmed beats at 170 BPM, and, of course, Fohr’s flexile voice, notably able to span four octaves. “God dick in my way,” she intones, darkly: “Horns growing, phallus dei.”\nSuch intensity tends to fuel all of Fohr’s work, which is often rooted in the deepest crevasses of the human condition. Her 2017 album,Reaching for Indigo,was borne out of a spiritual awakening that left her “convulsing and vomiting.” Her previous record,-io, was inspired by a grief-filled artistic retreat. Even Fohr’s more playful side project,Jackie Lynn, couches character studies in elaborate role play.\nFohr’s latest record as Circuit des Yeux,Halo on the Inside, is less specific in its origins, gesturing instead at a simpler terror: change. She wrote the album alone, under the blanket of night. It’s a lonely record about indiscernible metamorphosis, drawing on a more heavily electronic palette than ever before. It’s Circuit des Yeux by way of industrial dance music: sludgy, colossal, and teeming with darkness.\nFrom the first few seconds of opener “Megaloner,”Halo on the Insideis immediately less concerned with Fohr’s guitar and the orchestral arrangements highlighted on-io. Instead, attention is split between her haunting voice and a slew of synthesizers, all fit for a sweaty, cement-walled basement. The percussion, which spans knuckles, storm drums, and drum machines, is deep andloud, rattling headphones and frequently thumping above the mix. It bores its way into your head, alchemizing from the inside out.\nHalo on the Insidealso, refreshingly, speaks to the pop music of the past. “Organ Bed” features a sly saxophone solo and a jungle of propulsive texture that, at times, sounds like a more anxious and gothic version ofPeter Gabriel’s “Mercy Street.” The dungeon-core “Canopy of Eden” could fit on any ’90sDepeche Moderecord, with Fohr’s operatic wails echoing behind a pulsing techno wub. It’s Circuit des Yeux’s own wall of sound, girded by a combination of emotion and grandeur.\nInvoking the pop sounds of yore results in some of Fohr’s most accessible work yet. “I can make a radio break,” she repeats on “Canopy of Eden,” a phrase that serves as a double entendre: both a striking moment of self-awareness and an allusion to the music destroying its vessel. Much like the metamorphosis she sings about, the album shifts to more maximalist fare, switching the discordant orchestra for swelling electro-cacophony. And even though it might not hit the terrestrial airwaves, it would go gangbusters at the blood rave inBlade.\nFohr’s lyrics often function less as songs and more as poems, renderings of tragic transformations and emotional crossroads. From a less confident artist, her writing might sound trite, but vocal experimentation is Fohr’s strength. The malleable and arresting delivery at the album’s core pushes the music forward, often reinventing itself mid-song. “Truth is just imagination of the mind,” she repeats on “Truth,” spinning that simple phrase into layered webs by surrounding it with amorphous incantations. The record’s sixth track, “Cathexis,” is essentially Fohr’s version of “Waking the Witch” byKate Bush, where whispers swirl around like blustering cliffside winds.\nBy the end of the record, the horror becomes all-consuming. Fohr’s songwriting has always contained touches of darkness, but this is the first time the shadows have been so alien. AsHalo on the Insidegestures at eldritch change, it neither soothes nor shows the light. It instead becomes an enveloping cocoon of helplessness, with only Fohr’s voice cutting through to serve as a guide.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "At first glance, it seems likeHorse Visionbuild their debut album,Another Life,from wholly familiar ingredients. Its drop-D tuning, rhotic vocals, and pastoral guitar passages would slot in nicely on the shelf betweenAlex GandPinegrove. But then the Swedish duo of Johan Nilsson and Gabriel von Essen will throw in something unexpected: They interpolate a classic pop song, or get Swedish singer Tiffi M to sing an Auto-Tuned chorus straight out of aPorter Robinsontrack, or drop what might be the most heartwarming MIDI airhorn riff ever put to tape.Another Lifeisn’t strictly Americana, but it does feel informed by an American attitude, winking at the tropes of U.S. pop culture right now—gratuitous mashups,unblinking earnestness,shaky irony—in a way that only two outsiders could pull off. In the process, they craft something goofy but undeniably beautiful: an album that finds the potential for heartfelt sentiment even as it contends with the postmodern muck.\nHorse Vision, for their part, positionAnother Lifeas the natural way to make art in the 2020s; in a statement, they affirm that the album aims “to depict the world of music, rather than the world itself.” That description might scan like puffery, but it makes a lot of sense when listening toAnother Life. Zoom in, and this album feels like a piece of music criticism in the vein of, say, a DJ EarwormUnited State of Popmegamix. It credibly taps into indie music’s main modes right now (country, emo, and shoegaze) and nods to the primary ways artists try to subvert the expectations of those styles (hyperpop-adjacent synths, ambient passages, Auto-Tune). It does not sound like most new music in those genres, though: “Partly Get By” and “Another Life,” perhaps purely because of their accented vocals, sound a little like slowed-and-reverbed versions of songs by fellow SwedeBladee, and the album’s electronic elements are joyous rather than rooted in pathos.\nIt would be a wry parody of American indie culture if not for how earnest it all is: The album’s final lyrics are simply, “You are lovelorn/You are/Yeah, you are,” a terseness that’s reflected in the song’s disintegrating breakbeat. The scintillating “Chemicals”—the song with the MIDI airhorn—features a sappy, romantic chorus: “Can’t stop when my heart’s wide open/I give you my arms if you need them.” The closest analogue to Horse Vision might beA. G. Cook, best known as a hyperpop super-producer but whose solo work in recent years has prioritized fairly straightforward, earnest guitar ballads, only occasionally augmented by a bell or whistle. Both feel like an attempt to reconcile a love of “traditional” songwriting with the formless electronic maelstrom that has been sold as “the future of music” in various permutations for the past 20 years—and a disavowal of the idea that innovation requires abandoning what came before."

    "review_text": "Behind every home lies a network of pipes, valves, and vents. Behind every relationship, an engineered performance of power, sublimation, and ego. In her debut solo album,Affectionately,Raisa K, a member ofGood Sad Happy Bad(formerlyMicachu and the Shapes), exposes the wiring and guts of both: the machinery of domesticity and the inner workings of love.\nIn London’s experimental DIY scene, where all roads lead back toMica Levi, Raisa K has managed to create a work that stands outside their formidable shadow. One can still hear some of the same vernacular onAffectionately: the unreal poise, the wry melodies, the clattering soundscapes. But here, Raisa K deviates from the willfully primitive music of Good Sad Happy Bad to deliver something much more measured, refined, and complete. Maintaining the gestures of lo-fi rock while couching them within ambient-industrial soundscapes,Affectionatelypushes its listener right between the walls of a home. The album feels wholly insulated and airtight.\nThe album seems to take place in the midst of romantic conflict, and its structure mirrors the rhythms of argument, vacillating between momentum and exhaustion. The music feels hot, stuffy, and stifling; Raisa K’s vigorously engineered and kettling beats sound like trapped air clanging inside hot radiators. There are hints of shoegaze in her fuzzed-out guitar tone, but where shoegaze presents a looming wall of sound, the mixdown here resembles a speaker enclosed behind drywall. The effect borders on the spectral, much the way a refrigerator’s hum can sound heavenly once you zone in on it. Raisa K toys with this kind of mundane psychedelia. Listen to the tiny metallic clanks buried within the wash of what sounds like a severely overheated laptop fan on “Both Still.” She invites only brief glimpses of the sentimental sounds of twinkling percussion, before overwhelming them with downsampled dust. She consistently yanks the sound back from transcendence, just barely stopping it short of touching that white-hot nerve in the soul. She carries this highly ambitious and admirable level of restraint across the whole album.\n“The only thing that betters my mind is to be calm,” she sings on “How Did You Know,” with great composure. The line captures the album’s motivation: to find meaning in conflict by surrendering to one’s own serenity. “We can both say our piece/And we can still be at peace,” she sings on “Still,” and, “Don’t say a word yet/You need to calm down,” on “Come Down.” It takes great courage to look at the complexity of romantic friction as coolly as Raisa K does onAffectionately. She takes a direct and clarifying lens to love, maintaining a respectful pose throughout the entire album, and calmly leafing through difficult matters in the simplest terms possible."

This was back when “gatekeeping” still mattered. The journey into music for New Jersey streamerPlaqueBoyMaxhas been much smoother. Beyond the usual factors of relatability and charisma, Max has a semblance of taste, which the streaming world woefully lacks. On his streams, which routinely rack up tens of thousands of concurrent viewers, he’s helped put on a new generation of rappers likeLazer Dim 700andNino Paidby featuring them in online shows like “Song Wars,” where songs are pitted against each other in a bracket, with winners determined by a panel of judges. (The Fader’s Vivian Medithi aptlydescribedit as “American Idolfor the SoundCloud set.”)\nAlmost like an undergroundDJ Khaled, PlaqueBoyMax is good at assembling records by calling up his contacts, picking beats from his Discord community, and catching a vibe. As his platform has grown, he’s shown he can find common ground with virtually any guest, fromCentral CeetoWill Smith, like a late-night TV host. His music aptitude really comes into focus in his series “In The Booth,” where he engineers sessions in real time for rappers, meticulously punching them in, line by line, giving us unexpected collabs like the rapturousBabyChiefDoIt/Nino Paid song “Coolin.” Sure, streaming is altogether pretty uncool, a sign of male loneliness and the death rattle for traditional media, but if we have to live with it, I’ll take “Coolin” over Adin Ross kissing Donald Trump’s ass.\nSo what happens when Max himself starts rapping? That’s the question his debut solo mixtape,Five Forever, tries to answer. What is gleaned across these 13 songs is that surrounding yourself with cool people can only take you so far; at some point, you’ve gotta have something original to say, too.\nReleased on Zack Bia’sField Trip Recordings, which, of course it is,Five Foreverfinds Max trying out different trending styles like he’s a character inGTAflipping through fits: He’sKen Carsonon “Sevan,” deep-voicedCartion “Yacht,”Summrson “Tank Davis.” None of it is remotely inspiring; none of it sticks to your brain. “Rockstar lifestyle, rockstar lifestyle, she tryna get drunk, she tryna get piped down,” he moans on “Rockstar,” lyrics you might find typed out by a fan in the YouTube comments of aYeattype beat."

    "review_text": "“I feel strange,” Alex Sauser-Monnig sings on their new record,Alex, “but it’s just a natural reaction to a world coming apart at the seams.” In the six years sinceDawnbraker, their debut asDaughter of Swords, the world’s only come more unglued;Alexis a frenetic coming-out party before the clock strikes midnight. Musically, the album recalls a decade-old strain of perky, chart-aspiring indie pop, the purview of bands likeMisterWivesorOh Wonder—only these songs have far more on their mind.Alexapplies the playful sound of early-2010s alt-pop to the more troubling realities of life as queer person in the mid-2020s, without feeling like escapism. Sauser-Monnig’s brief vignettes are little pockets of joy amid societal strife andsystemic erasure.\nLikeDawnbreaker, Alexwas produced by Nick Sanborn ofSylvan Esso, this time joined by bandmate Amelia Meath (Meath and Sauser-Monnig also play together inMountain Man). Unlike the more muted debut,Alexis upbeat and endearingly eager to please; anyone unwilling to use a goofy cartoon sound effect to allude to sex should steer clear. Those who have a soft spot for this kind of quirked-up indie pop will be handsomely rewarded. Sauser-Monnig devotes the opening tracks to the thrill of a new crush, filling “Talk to You” with handclaps and starting off “Hard On” like a bedroom-pop version of ’80s glam rock. “I got a hard on for loving you,” they croon. It’s a cheekynod to gender dysphoria, but the way Sauser-Monnig’s songs address such awakenings feels more mischievous than didactic, like a child trying out a new curse word.\nUnderneathAlex’s cutesy presentation are some very real issues, and the album might verge on glib “hey look we’re bombing Iraq” territory if Sauser-Monnig didn’t handle the subject matter creatively. On the tongue-in-cheek garage rocker “Vacation,” their narrator plays millionaire for a day and discovers a life of luxury and top-shelf liquor that’s too good to resist: “Lying by the tennis court/You touch my thigh below my skort/And I’m gone.” They counter theSheryl Crow-esque chorus of “Money Hits” with climate-apocalypse scenes of “running through the woods/While the water rises.” It’s probably the only song about late capitalism with a goofy staccato piano solo in the middle, and somehow it captures the cognitive dissonance in a way an outwardly mournful song cannot.\nWhen the pace slows, there are a few moments of true rest: The unassuming “Willow” sounds like it might sway back and forth forever. At times the songs’ polish outweighs their complexity, like when “Morning in Madison” begins to resemble George Ezra’s cloying adult contemporary hit “Budapest.” But Sauser-Monnig usually earns the benefit of the doubt, even at their most saccharine. “Hello to the day/Coffee in the shade/Blues in the sun/Trying to have fun,” they sing on “Dance.” It’s simple stuff, but such is daily life in a crisis. OnAlex, Sauser-Monnig certainly sounds like they’re having fun; they’re just not in denial about everything else.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "In early 2002, in a rented house in Northeast Los Angeles—one whose 1950s bomb shelter with 18-inch concrete walls had been refitted as a studio space—MadlibandMF DOOMbegan working, quickly and with little forethought or even communication, on what would becomeMadvillainy. The contractual terms had been scrawled on a paper plate; DOOM was in a rush to return to his children in Georgia; by the end of the year, a version of the album would be leaked from a stolen cassette, nearly scuttling its commercial release but underlining underground rap fans’ yearning for the pairing. For more than a year, that leaked copywasthe Madvillain project. When the official LP was eventually released, the leak’s legacy became a slew of message board threads debating the relative merits of the two.\nNow that leak has been reissued by Stones Throw under the titleMadvillainy Demos. While this is technically true—these are earlier incarnations of songs that would undergo changes before their official release—it nevertheless reframes this collection of tracks, no longer an alternate path for the duo, but a step toward an inevitable end product. This is even reflected in the titling conventions: What was once “Powerball 5” is now merely “Figaro (demo),” and so on. The sequencing is also different from the most widely circulated bootleg, which serves less to create a new arc to the record and more to cast that order as arbitrary. And yet,Demosclarifies DOOM’s remarkable attention to detail, even in the album’s most haphazard moments.\nAside from some minor adjustments to the lyrics, the biggest difference between the two versions ofMadvillainyis the register of DOOM’s voice. On the final copy, he rerecorded his takes in a low, slow monotone that reflected his transformation from a rapper who darted across the tops of beats to one who buried himself deep in their pockets. That deeper voice projects a sense of control, of unflappability; the comparatively manic takes found here actually evoke the villain motif. On the early draft of “Meat Grinder”—here called “Just For Kicks,” known in the original .zip file as “Wake Uppers”—lines like “At the gates of heaven, knocking/No answer” scan as sinister rather than wearied. My comma placement there is deliberate; the words would stay the same for “Meat Grinder,” but the syllables would fall in a different, sleepier cadence. (The counterexample to this vocal trajectory is the “Fancy Clown” demo, which is actually delivered in a much lower tone, reminiscent of the white-labelreleasesof early DOOM singles like “Dead Bent.”)"

    "review_text": "Ringo Starrwasthe Beatles’ cowboy: the grizzled, silent type, from the wrong side of the tracks, with a roughly emotive voice redolent of heartbroken days rounding up cattle. So of course the songs he sang for the Beatles were those where the Liverpool band embraced its country music influences—notably on “Act Naturally,” a Johnny Russell/Buck Owens number that Starr performed like a man with a crippling hangover on a horse ride to Misery.\nStarr made a country album in 1970:Beaucoups of Blues, which he recorded in Nashville with pedal steel player Pete Drake. Fifty-five years later, he returns to the genre onLook Up, this time in the company ofT Bone Burnett, the formerDylanguitarist whose work withElvis CostelloandRobert Plantsuggests a gift for teasing cowpoke swing out of elderly English gentlemen.\nYou could make a case for this being Burnett’s album as much as Starr’s. The production is modern but not aggressively so, and full of wonderfully sensitive touches, like the luxurious cradle of pedal steel and strings that winds around “Time on My Hands.” Burnett plays guitar on most tracks and has songwriting credits on nine of the 11 songs, to Starr’s one. But the Nashville-based producer knows we’ve all come here for a Beatle, and his songs are perfectly judged for Starr’s air of hangdog melancholy and limited but poignant vocal tone.\nThe title song is tailor made for Starr to undersell, its positive messaging—“Up above your head/Where the music plays/There’s a light that shines/In the darkest days”—slyly subverted by his characteristic Liverpudlian ennui. On “Never Let Me Go,” the distinct air of Merseybeat cuts through the Nashville finery, right down to its “Love Me Do”-esque harmonica melody. It’s the kind of song Lennon and McCartney might have knocked up in an afternoon to give their drummer something to sing on the Beatles’ second album of the calendar year. And Starr responds well to such handling: He’s in fine voice throughout the record, the slight rasp on “Come Back” the only real evidence of the passing years—and one that suits the song’s rueful stroll.\nSadly, his fantastically expressive percussive style isn’t as well served. The drumming onLook Upis solid, but Starr only lets his personality shine on the opener, “Breathless,” where he deploys his characteristic tumbling drum fills; the fabric of ’60s nostalgia unfolds in lazy tom hits and the electrifying cymbal rush that lit up so many Beatles songs. The sidelining of his talents on the kit is a disappointment, but it’s not a deal breaker. On the whole,Look Upsucceeds for the same reasons thatBeaucoups of Bluesdid: songs that play to Starr’s vocal strengths, a sympathetic supporting cast, and a natural, Nashville feel.\nThe album isn’t entirely without risk, and one of the best songs comes when Burnett pushes the boat out a little. Billy Strings’ growling electric guitar line gives “Rosetta” a grunge-y, drone-y feel that complements Starr’s gruffly welcoming voice. It’s neither a wild experiment or a late-period artistic upheaval in theJohnny Cash/Rick Rubinmodel. But compared to Joe Walsh’s ill-advised anti-internet “rap” on “Gotta Get Up to Get Down,” from Starr’s previous album,What's My Name, the song shows that the former Beatle doesn’t have to be cased in amber.\nThatLook Upis relevant enough to appeal beyond longtime fans is partly thanks to musical fashion coming around to Starr. But the former Beatle has the doleful vocal charm to sound at home in country music, the shrewdness to pick the right collaborators, and the sense to—well—act naturally among them. Craggy, wounded, and oddly philosophical,Look Upmakes a timely case for Starr as one of the UK’s most convincing country singers, his gritty Liverpool blues stretching right back across the Atlantic.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Trauma permeatesRainy Miller’s music—it’s sodden with it, like an overcoat peeled off after a downpour. Sometimes he expresses it through violent outbursts—spoken-word screeds that turn anger both outwards at the world, and inwards at the id. Other times, that hurt is sublimated, swaddled in Auto-Tune and ambient textures. Still present, but buried, made numb.\nHailing from Preston, in Lancashire, Miller is one of a loose fraternity of artists with roots in North West England—see alsoaya, Blackhaine, andIceboy Violet—taking grime, drill, and club music and retooling it as a sort of avant-garde confessional art.Joseph, What Have You Done?sits loosely in the idiom of sadboi post-Drakerap. But in Miller’s hands, the form dissolves, manifesting in sheets of rumbling noise or gentle tides of synth that hit like a warm rush of intoxication.\nMiller figured out the building blocks of this sound on 2022’sDesquamation (Fire, Burn. Nobody). OnJoseph, What Have You Done?, he’s learning how to locate his struggle on a wider canvas, lacing his confessionals with Biblical imagery and memories from his Lancashire upbringing. One of the record’s influences isSearching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus, a 2003 BBC travelogue around the American South hosted by the country singerJim White. Miller recognized something in White’s journey that chimed with his own lived experience: a landscape of nowhere towns populated by people who refuse to let their disadvantage dislodge their pride in themselves and their communities. OnJoseph, What Have You Done?, Miller sets out to transpose that film’s documentarian approach to his Lancastrian ends, creating an aesthetic that he calls “Northern Gothic.”\nThe album begins on a note of grim prophecy. “We were born with a mark on our backs,” mutters Miller at the start of “Mud in My Mouth. (Predetermined Definitions).” That pronouncement is the opening for a monologue that builds in intensity. “You was born to be nothing,” he repeats, and the track peaks right at the moment you hear his voice crack with emotion, the breaking point where anger crumbles into sorrow.\nDepression and dispossession hang overJoseph, What Have You Done?like a storm cloud. They’re there in “Toddbrook Dam, 2019.” and “Mary Magdalene, as a Home.,”King Krule-esque ballads on which Miller accompanies his pained mumble with strumming and simple arpeggios on an acoustic guitar. And they linger throughout the moody psychogeography of “Then Casts Shadows, From Afar (A6 - Pendleton).,” a love letter to someone unnamed but now absent, told from the threadbare seat of a bus somewhere on the dual carriageway between Manchester and Preston. Accentuating the album’s documentary sensibility, Miller scatters voice notes throughout—off-the-cuff monologues muttered into a phone that often pack a devastating payload. On “Marked, 2020.,” he recalls an accidental sighting of his estranged biological father near Preston’s St George’s Shopping Centre—and the resulting emotional fallout."

    "review_text": "LEYA can find the beauty in any sound, no matter how unsettling. The New York-based duo of harpist Marilu Donovan and violinist/vocalist Adam Markiewicz revealed as much inan interviewearlier this year, when they were asked about their most rewarding recent listening experiences. Donovan described the joys of hearing roosters screeching at a farm in Atlanta; Markiewicz enthused about the chaos of the New York City subway trains. “Their sound holds every buzz and slap and orchestral moment you might care to hear,” he said. “There is music everywhere, but especially there.”\nThe duo’s new mini-albumI Forget Everythingreflects this disposition toward close listening. It also reveals their knack for wringing tranquility out of overwhelming gloom. Since their 2018 debut, LEYA have used a simple palette. Donovan plays a uniquely detuned harp, which lends delicate unease to every track; rather than the empyrean grace the instrument typically connotes, her playing is ghostly and tense. Markiewicz’s contributions are suitably opaque and foggy, his vocals billowing over the ashes of the duo’s damaged strings. OnI Forget Everything, they occasionally weave in distant washes of ambience or other smoggy electronics, but they largely stick to their chosen instruments, furthering their single-minded search for complicated beauty.\n“Weaving,” which braids a tense and discordant harp arpeggio around the gentle swell of Markiewicz’s vocals and violin, feels like an especially effective version of their sound. It’s gentle but unsteady; the warmth of Markiewicz’s voice serves as a guide through the treacherous landscape of the strings. Pillowy, yet otherworldly and intense, it’s an example of dream pop that echoes the surreal, unearthly atmosphere of more upsetting REM cycles.\nA pair of short pieces later on the record show what happens when the duo pushes further into abstraction and uncertainty. On “Baited,” Markiewicz’s meditative vocal line is wrapped in a delicate electronic loop that shimmers and shifts without really fully resolving into a proper melody. “Fake” uses a dreary, sparse harp figure as the accompaniment for an ambient ballad, both achingly emotional and upsettingly vertiginous—it’s a little like what might be revealed if you peeled back the layers of aCocteau Twinsarrangement to its barest form. It presents a possible future direction for the band—they’ve always somewhat playfully understood their sound as a sort of pop music, but the most compelling moments onI Forget Everythinghappen when they abandon conventional structures for something a little stranger.\nBut amid the unease, LEYA find ways to let light in. It’s there in the opening moments of the record, a weightless bit of ambience that flutters like a roll of tulle unspooling in the wind. Even when Donovan’s harp is at its most discordant, there’s something soothingly intimate about it, the sustain of each plucked string trailing off in a way that feels reassuringly consistent—as if left untouched it might just keep ringing forever. LEYA say thatI Forget Everythingwas written from a place of “confusion and exhaustion,” and that’s certainly audible, but it’s deceptively hopeful music too. There’s a sense that they’ll find some peace from the turbulence, if they just keep looking for it."

    "review_text": "In the waning weeks of 1970,Alice Coltraneput the finishing touches on her latest album,Journey in Satchidananda, recorded in the basement of her Long Island home, in a studio her late husbandJohn Coltranehad conceived, but didn’t live to see through to completion. She wrote the album’s liner notes and commented on her imminent five-week trip through India and Ceylon (soon to be rechristened Sri Lanka) with her guru, Swami Satchidananda. But for the seekers and yoga students who idealize the spiritual airs of India, the street-level air of the country can be a rude awakening. There’s a reason that both meditation and incense originate there, as the sensory overload is profound and pungent. Mindful breathing might include snootfuls of diesel exhaust and frangipani, curry and cow dung, rot and sandalwood. Coltrane’s grand-nephew,Flying Lotus, would later describe that scent to me as “the funk of ages” recalling travelling with her there decades later.\nAnd then there was Alice, a tall Black woman from America, amid the bustle of the country, lugging a magnificent harp everywhere. “It was stunning to people there that somebody came from the West to play. She made quite an impression—but she was always very modest,” one student said. A 16 mm film documenting the travels of Satchidananda at that time also offers up the sight of Alice Coltrane—who grew up in the Baptist church in Detroit’s Paradise Valley neighborhood—beingplunged in the frigid, clear sacred waters of the Ganges Riverway up in the Himalayas. She would welcome the new year in India. After five weeks there, Coltrane returned to the United States revitalized and reborn.\nAs she would explain inan interviewwith Columbia University student radio station WKCR later in 1971: “The past four years have really been involved in that aspect of really trying to see what’s going on and finding my place in the spiritual world. So now I feel that I’ve gotten some answers; I’ve gotten quite a few answers. There isn’t such an urgency as it was before to really go into meditation and spend so many hours in-drawn. Now I feel that I’ve been given an opportunity to come out, to be with you tonight, to play, and get into music. This is really what I felt from the meditation. Now is the time to really look at music.”\nThat urgency, those answered answers, that sense of her place in the spiritual world, that deep look at music, all are conveyed in Coltrane’s fifth studio album,Universal Consciousness. Composed barely five months after the spiritual jazz masterpieceJourney in Satchidananda,Universal Consciousnessis every bit the equal of its predecessor and at times soars even further into stratospheric realms."

    "review_text": "Hotline TNTare putting the power back in power pop. We’re familiar with the niche the New York quartet has carved for itself within the shoegaze revival: lean, hooky songwriting beefed up by pedalboard scuzz. With each new release, though, the group’s fuzzy guitars and earworm choruses seem to get more muscular, and on its third LP,Raspberry Moon, there’s a newly realized arena-rock gleam that really lets each element shine. While it’s Hotline TNT’s most polished, accessible album to date, it also feels like the most substantive version of their work so far, repurposing their grit to massively catchy effect.\nRaspberry Moonis the first album written by the whole band, and there’s a new confidence to the music; the album’s very first strum, on opener “Was I Wrong?,” catapults us full force into a wall of sinewy, undulating guitars, ground-shaking bass, and drums that just won’t quit. The song also features frontman Will Anderson’s clearest vocals to date and a blistering guitar solo that whisks us out of the dive bar and into the hot plastic of stadium seating. That’s not to say the beer’s been watered down—quite the opposite. If previously some of the band’s songwriting fell victim to the weighted-blanket crush of shoegaze reverb,Raspberry Mooncasts off the haze just enough to properly showcase each band member’s talents—not to mention additional keys, percussion, and background vocals from producer Amos Pitsch, ofTenement, who’s credited as a fifth member. The more judicious application of shoegaze texture uses fuzz as an accent rather than an all-pervasive filter, letting each instrument come clearly into its own.\nNot only are the dimensions bigger than ever, but the songwriting’s more varied. Never before have we heard something like the cutie-pie moonlight twinkle of “Dance the Night Away” from Hotline TNT, nor the campfire-readyna na nas in the chorus of “Julia’s War” (the title being a nice shoutout to They Are Gutting a Body of Water, peers in the shoegaze-revival vanguard), but these stylistic experiments sound more like natural expansions of their previous sound than pivots away from it. And though the lovelorn sentiment that dominated 2023’sCartwheelpersists, there are also more expressions of hope, adoration, and perseverance. Professions of love are written just as plainly as moments of defeat, but the strength of the band’s arrangements makes the lines feel all-encompassing. On “Candle,” the simple couplet “I wanna try/Get butterflies” hits particularly hard, propelled by the most heartbeat-quickening drumline on the entire album."

    "review_text": "Three songs intoMurder During Drug Traffic,Boldy Jamessounds like he can barely keep his eyes open. Though his monotone hardly rises above a mumble on “Custo,” the vocals are aggressively, uncomfortably close; you can almost feel the wind of his breath as he enunciates each “p.” His verses are sharp and savage, complementing the blaring horns and twangy guitar licks, but Boldy himself is moments away from disappearing. He’s on his third cup of lean, the drug loosening his tether to reality, his brain cycling through memories fraught with tension and trauma. Something wicked and inescapable lurks around every corner and at the end of every stretch of highway; the recitation of a code he’s known all his life, “Either you the dealer or the custo,” is like a resignation to an inevitable fate.\nFor over a decade, Boldy’s been poring over these recollections, drawing from a seemingly bottomless well of heavy-lidded hustler tales. It can be hard to keep up with his output as he’s made a custom of dropping at least three or four albums every year, but he’s stayed fresh by teaming up with a succession of producers. In January 2023, Boldy and Blended Babies member RichGains released the excellentIndiana Jones, a strange and smoldering collection that felt like Boldy’s version of an acid-fried psych-rock record. It seemed to disappear almost immediately, partly because of its sharp deviation from the heavier boom-bap sounds of 2022’sKilling NothingorMr. Ten08, but mostly because it was overshadowed by a brutal car accident earlier in the month that left Boldy temporarily paralyzed. Listening toIndiana Jonesnow, it seems eerily prescient: Buried in the mix, Boldy’s vocals take on a disembodied affect, and the wispy guitars and reverberant synths swirl together in an anesthetic haze.\nNow, two years later, RichGains and Boldy reunite on the similarly murkyMurder During Drug Traffic, an impressive refinement of what madeIndiana Jonesso compelling. As on last year’sPenalty of Leadership, Boldy’s second album withNicholas Craven, the crash looms large in his psyche. None of the shock and terror have faded, and Boldy seems unsure of exactly how to cope with the grief. The first lyrics on the album, “I don’t know how to feel,” are a plain-hearted lament, and even though they’re delivered with his signature stoicism, it’s perhaps the most nakedly emotional Boldy’s ever come across. Seconds later, though, he corrects himself. It’s not that he doesn’t know how to feel; it’s that he doesn’t want to. His vocals sit prominently in the mix throughout the album, devoid of modulating effects. Boldly’s indoor-voice raps can sound like he’s whispering in your ear, but these stark, intimate confessionals feel urgent, often desperate. He’s emerged from the miasmic fog ofIndiana Jones, but its threatening presence hovers behind him, nipping at his heels."

Emblazoned with a blurry photograph of the artist on its cover, the 2023 release inaugurated Halo’s label,Awe, with an implicit challenge: Good luck getting a bead on the American composer. Over the past decade and a half, her discography has run throughavant-pop,minimalist electronics,ambient jazz fusion, and even tough,propulsiveclub music;Atlasdrove home her determination to be elusive.\nAwe’s second release, from Danish artistsMK VelsorfandAase Nielsen, at first seems like it couldn’t be further fromAtlas’ zero-visibility murk. The mood is relaxed, a little ruminative—occasionally anxious or slightly wistful, but only in an absent-minded way. The music appears even less complicated than the mood. Everything is right there on the surface: patient electric piano, trim lines of clean-tone electric guitar, lilting loops of hand percussion. None of it is much more forceful than a long sigh. Repeated phrases twist slowly in place, like mobiles; despite a thin papering of reverb, there’s no disguising that these songs are mostly empty space.\nIfOpening Nightsounds like background music, that’s because it is. Velsorf (aka Mads Kristian Højlund Frøslev, ofTLF Trio) and Nielsen (director of Copenhagen’sBoli Group, and a session player with credits forDean BluntandSlim0) wrote these pieces for the inauguration of New Theater Hollywood, an experimental space run by artists Calla Henkel and Max Pitegoff out of the former 2nd Stage Theater, a 49-seat venue on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles. Ensconced in the balcony, the two musicians serenaded guests as they entered, filled the time between celebratory speeches, and kept playing as attendees, presumably, sipped bubbly and snacked on canapes. The album was recorded on the spot. (Halo sits in on piano on one song.) In the longest piece, the nearly 16-minute title track, the murmur of crowd noise burbles faintly beneath drum-machine pitter-patter and breezy synth-and-guitar interplay, breaking the fourth wall and turning partygoers into extras.\nStylistically,Opening Nightfalls in with a recent wave of self-consciously chill material with one foot in the cut-out bins; I’m thinking of the spongy new-age fusion ofTotal Blue, the lackadaisical pop-rock ofJack J, the smeary ambient jazz ofLifted, the bedroom Balearic ofHotspring. But Velsorf and Nielsen’s music is more skeletal than any of those reference points; it does more with less. Songs are built out of simple looping phrases that soldier dutifully on without pause or variation. The sound quality is unvarnished, the rhythms rudimentary—the drum machine sounds like one of those old wood-paneled gizmos with preset foxtrot beats—and the frills nil."

    "review_text": "John Glacier’s debut studio album,Like a Ribbon, arrives with all the laudatory press (“perhaps one of the most London-defining artists of her era”) that comes baked into a release on Young, two years after she was featured, standing in front of Big Ben, in Daniel Lee’s first campaignfor Burberry. It liberally references both the stylish post-punk rasp of London’s contemporary pop underground and the cool-kid electronic music that’s defined Young and sister label XL in the 21st century.\nMany would wither in this kind of heat, but London-born Glacier is made of sturdier stuff. For all its familiarity—on both a musical and narrative level—Like a Ribbonis lush and engrossing, the rare Big Indie debut that outstrips its own hype. A lot of this can be chalked up to Glacier herself: She is a resolute, unflappable vocalist with a deep, unyielding deadpan that bleeds across the page. AlthoughLike a Ribbonfeatures producers as disparate asFlume,Evilgiane, and Kwes Darko, Glacier’s presence is a unifying force; like a Chantal Akerman protagonist, she floats through her environments with an unshowy magnetism, subtly shifting the atmosphere around her as she goes.\nLike a Ribbonfeels like a time lapse in album form, with Glacier’s largely arhythmic deadpan the only constant. Although she raps about parties, relationships, and her career, Glacier’s most indelible images come from peering at the edge of the frame. On “Found,” she zeroes in on “new green grass where the grass never knew,” a poignant, small-scale picture of renewal; the crunchy post-punk track “Money Shows” ends with an image of summer melting into autumn, a stark perspective shift after a song about the frantic life of a working musician. Although she’s willing to engage in the occasional Hot Young Rapper trope (“You best believe it, I’m the hottest in the game,” she raps on the twinkly rave track “Emotions”), Glacier always inevitably wanders back toward the natural world, an essential force in her music. If there’s an aesthetic push-pull at the heart ofLike a Ribbon—between the simplicity of Glacier’s delivery and the relative busyness of her production—it’s one that echoes the relationship between the natural world and the city, one side offering respite and the other excitement.\nAlthough Glacier is—not incorrectly—classified as a rapper by most, there’s a looseness to that tag that she happily exploits acrossLike a Ribbon. Over the dusty electric guitar that opens “Satellites,” she sounds a little likeKing Krule; delivering something close to a sing-song cadence on “Emotions,” you can hear the faintest echo of earlyM.I.A. And a lot of the album recallsDean Blunt’s stuttering indie-post-punk-rap, as well as the work of his collaborators, likeMica Levi,Inga Copeland, andTirzah. The industrial chug that powers “Home” feels of a piece with Levi and Tirzah’s work on the stark, achingtrip9love…???."

    "review_text": "Bands will always sound like this: jangly and raw, infatuated with their own youth, terribly and vaguely romantic, tripping over themselves in their haste to convey a botanic garden’s worth of full-bloom feelings.Radio DDR, the second album bySharp Pins(the solo project ofLifeguard’s Kai Slater) is a giddy blast of power pop that understands, deeply, that the genre’s only goal should be to make age-old feelings like love and longing sound thrilling and new. It succeeds and surpasses that goal: Familiar but finely tuned, it’s likely to remind you of whatever music felt most romantic to you when you were growing up. For me, that’sRoyal Headacheandthe BeatlesandHunx and His PunxandGirls; for you, maybethe KinksorCleaners From VenusorAlvvays. The album’s recombinant DNA is an asset—or, at the very least, not a hindrance—because 20-year-old Slater is also one of contemporary indie-rock’s sharpest pop songwriters, each of the record’s 14 songs containing its own cosmos of urgent choruses and natty phrases and artfully scrawled riffs.Radio DDRearns its comparison points, slamming you so hard and so frequently with scream-a-long hooks that it feels like a greatest-hits collection.\nIn addition to his duties in Sharp Pins, Slater is a lynchpin of Chicago’s young, fruitful guitar band scene: He runs a zine called Hallogallo that shares its name with a prolific DIY collective that also includesHorsegirl, Post Office Winter, and Slater’s other bands, Lifeguard and Dwaal Troupe. He’s also obsessed with youth culture, and toread him talk aboutits centrality in his life—“the only thing that I know I can do in the world is make youth spaces,” he says—unlocks a layer of meaning withinRadio DDR. These songs are about love, by and large, but they also ache with the notion that certain parts of life will inevitably slip away. They lurch forward urgently, like Slater is trying to bottle the feeling of being young before the fountain runs dry.\nIs it frustrating that society and pop culture writ large centers around Being Young? Maybe, but it’s an easier pill to swallow when it tastes this good. The halting boogie of “You Have A Way” is a vortex of anxieties and boredoms that can boil down to one lyric—“Can I find a time with you?” Meanwhile, Slater chases “the seconds/I can’t suspend anymore” on the frantic, anthemic garage barnstormer “Is It Better.” “I Can’t Stop” sounds like something Royal Headache’s Shogun might have made in his teenage bedroom, and one repeated lyric makes this theme even more explicit: “I don’t wanna get older no more.”\nAll ofRadio DDRcarries this feeling of racing against the clock, which is part of the (perhaps oxymoronic) appeal: Slater’s lyrics reflect the invincibility and assuredness of youth, but his melodies are shot through with the melancholy that comes with getting older and realizing that the infallibility of your late teens and early 20s is just another ephemeral feeling. Slater makes these feelings sound impossibly potent: The “ahh-ahh-ahh” on “Storma Lee” is wistful enough to cause palpitations in even the sturdiest heart; when he sings “If I was ever lonely/Oh, how it’d tear me apart,” hitting those last three words with a glam swagger, you want to laugh at the hubris and the excitement of it all. This contradictory, lovestruck aura fills every corner ofRadio DDR; it’s immensely gratifying to listen and remember that bands like Sharp Pins will keep striving to capture these ineffable feelings as long as people are having them.

Their M.O. is right there in the name, an arrow tilted toward higher consciousness and higher planes: This is head music for spiritual beings and celestial bodies. Across three LPs and a smattering of EPs, they’ve floated a sui generis mixture of drifting ambient, driving funk, and buoyant electronic improv that’s notquitejazz, but also notnotjazz. Call it jazz by another means, in which Ableton, MPCs, and CDJs are as integral to the improvisational sprawl as old-school chops and changes.\nTheir name also might speak to the way that friends raise each other up, because Lifted are collaborative to the core.Trellis, their fourth album, stems from an extended 2022 session at Baltimore’s Temple House studios, improvising with guitaristDustin Wong, drummerJeremy Hyman, and multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Boeldt (akaMezey, fkaAdventure); the credits speak to the core duo’s open-door policy. Longtime palMotion Graphicsturns up playing piano on a song actually called “Open Door”;Earthen Sea(a.k.a. ex-Black Eyes/Mi Amimember Jacob Long) plays sax and percussion on “Warmer Cooler” and “The Latecomer”;Juju & Jordash’s Jordan GCZ lays down understated Rhodes chords on “All Right,” alongside an incandescent electric guitar lead from indie liferTim Kinsella(Joan of Arc,Cap’n Jazz). But rarely do those contributions stand out; this wouldn’t be a Lifted album if all the parts weren’t seamlessly melded—sometimes practically melted—into a porous psychedelic whole.\nTake “All Right,” which opens the album. A feathery loop of Wong’s guitar bubbles across the stereo field like an aquarium-themed screensaver. Field-Pickering sits behind the drum kit, evoking whitewater currents with eddies of cymbal taps and snare rolls. Kinsella’s guitar and Jordan GCZ’s Rhodes round out the stormy vibe, the latter the silver lining to the former’s thunderheads. Somewhere in there, a whole bunch of other stuff is going on: detuned doorbells, rainstick rustling, murmuring voices. Despite the muscular rush of the drums, it feels almost like ambient music."

    "review_text": "AreMoina band? They are three people who play music together and write “songs,” so technically, probably, yes. But the trio’s approach to composition is lopsided, wonky. They aren’t splatter-paint artists, not quite, but they have a slash-and-burn approach to what is essentially rock music. Perhaps that’s because two of the band’s three members have spent much of their music careers not making it.\nFor the decade preceding Moin’s debut album in 2021, Tom Halstead and Joe Andrews were active as the electronic duoRaime. The music they made was moody and oblong, stark soundscapes with rapid percussion and interjections of haunted synthesizer. Their music was dark, interested in texture more than rhythm. They were more techno-adjacent than techno. Their 2012 albumQuarter Tones Over a Living Linefeatures recordings of string instruments deconstructed and reconstituted atop a bed of industrial grumbling.\nSo it was quizzical if, in retrospect, not surprising when, three years ago, they rekindled a short-lived alliance with the powerhouse drummerValentina Magalettias Moin. What were these heady electronic dudes doing playing around on guitar? On the group’s debut,Moot!, we got the answer: They were doing just that—playing around. And thank God for that.\nMoot!is the most conventional of Moin’s three albums, a (relatively) straight-ahead instrumental post-hardcore record. With a grayscale tone and guitars that howl like wolves, it would have been a natural extension of Raime’s sound were it not for the addition of Magaletti—a prolific, boundaryless player, with experience in improv, house, pop, and more. Her asymmetrical percussion rhythms were the album’s defining feature. While Halstead and Andrews were noodling away scientifically, she sounded like 10 subway bucket drummers playing all at once.\nOn their second album,Paste, the group added more pronounced vocal samples, to great effect. A spoken-word snippet by writer Lynne Tillman, saying that a man hung up on her, is mesmerizing, disorienting, placed against a woozy drum beat and plinky guitar. Another song, “Forgetting Is Like Syrup,” includes a slowed-down vocal sample that eventually disintegrates with a cassette-jammed-in-the-tape-deck effect. The album is weird and haunted, less linear thanMoot!but more substantive.\nYou Never Endsomehow moves both closer and further from the center. There’s more glee, less terror. The songs slither. It’s a stretch to say there is regular rhythm here, but some songs do dance. “It’s Messy Coping” somehow sounds as much like techno as it doesFugazi. “C’mon Dive” uses a chopped-up, high-pitched vocal sample the way a jungle song might, and ups the ante for Magaletti’s roiling drums, which sound as colossal as the Hoover Dam. It’d be a weird DJ that could play this song, but a DJ nonetheless."

    "review_text": "An “old-world” quality suffusesGrails’ new albumMiracle Music, co-founder Emil Amoshas said. It’s something that runs deeper than the Eastern Orthodox aesthetics that have often cloaked the Portland band’s records, or the influences from South Asian music and pulp zombie and Western soundtracks that give their music such a distinctive whiff of countercultural freakiness—it’s more akin to the sensation you feel inTristan und Isoldewhen thewall of stringskicks in, or upon beholding a bruise-colored canvas byEl GrecoorVelázquez.Miracle Musicis one of Grails’ most painterly records, but the swaths of color only occasionally cohere into an image.\nThis is the second album from the revamped Grails lineup featuring multi-instrumentalistsIlyas Ahmed, Jesse Bates, and AE Paterra alongside the core duo of Amos and Alex Hall. Coming less than two years after 2023’sAnches En Maat,it’s their fastest turnaround between albums since their early days, but while that record brimmed with ’70s funk-rarity grandeur, this one operates on a much lower register. The drums are reduced to a patient cymbal tap, only occasionally breaking into a groove. The dynamic interplay is subtle, with ambient soup yielding reluctant rhythms; the destination of these nine tracks is the point of departure for most other Grails songs.\nThe boldest new splashes on the canvas are the horn arrangements—courtesy of Kelly Pratt, who’s lent marching-band pomp to everyone fromBeiruttoBob’s Burgers—and a malignant swirl of sampled choir that swoops through the margins like a ghost. The cleverest moments on the album come courtesy of these new toys, not least when “Silver Bells” peaks with a brass fanfare so pompous and triumphant you half expect Underdog to fly in and save the day, or when “Strange Paradise” fades into a doleful horn solo that’ll inspire nods of recognition in anyone who knows the nameDick Parry.\nBy no coincidence, those are the moments that push the music furthest toward filmic cheese. Calling instrumental rock “Morriconean” is a little like calling a movie Lynchian at this point, but film music runs deep in the band’s DNA. Paterra plays with kino-proggersZombi, named in tribute toone of the great ’70s horror films, and Grails’ recent list of recommended records forAquarium Drunkardis full of soundtracks to films you’ve probably never heard of.Miracle Musicshines when it channels these influences, as on the high Western drama of “Harmonious Living,” whose tension and twang would’ve made a great theme from a primetime TV show in the quasi-Western backwash ofBreaking Bad.But aimless tracks like “Primeval Lite I-III” and “Earthly Life” feel too much like watching a movie where you find yourself zoning out no matter how much you try to pay attention."

    "review_text": "GuitaristJeff Parker, 57 years old and with a few dozen albums out in the world, is having a moment. Some of that energy comes from his association with the International Anthem label, both as a leader and a sideman. As was true with his work withTortoise,Isotope 217, and other groups on Thrill Jockey in his early days, it’s a hometown imprint that specializes in a style of experimental music that reaches new audiences. And Parker’s playing style—probing and melodic, exploratory yet always coherent—endears him to the jazz-curious and old heads alike.\nAfter the ambitious cross-genre setSuite for Max Brown, Parker moved to another extreme with the lyrical solo offeringForfolksbefore settling into yet another mode with the 2022 live setMondays at the Enfield Tennis Academy. The latter was cut with his quartet—or IVtet, if you like—comprising Parker, alto saxophonist Josh Johnson, bassistAnna Butterss, and drummer Jay Bellerose during three evenings in 2019, as part of the group’s extended residency at the Los Angeles club ETA Highland Park. In one sense it found Parker in the most traditional of settings, playing small-group improvised jazz in an instrumental configuration that goes back to the form’s earliest days. But this group has an uncanniness born of its patient and process-oriented sound.\nThe Way out of Easy, cut with the same band at the same club in 2023, is certainly a sequel—it’s another double album, with four side-long pieces—but its differences suggest how much flexibility and surprise are possible within these parameters. The music seems slightly more emotionally open-ended, less likely to guide you to specific references or modes of feeling.\nThe opening “Freakadelic,” a Parker tune that dates back more than a decade, is taken at half the tempo ofthat earlier recording, and the slower speed allows for more air between the notes. The rhythm section carries a whiff of funk, hinting at the Art Blakey groove on “A Chant for Bu” that later formed the basis forA Tribe Called Quest’s “Excursions,” and Parker plays wry,Monk-like phrases, like he’s posing a series of riddles to the band that they try to answer.\nThese are mellow improvisations, easy to zone out to, but they’re also playful and surprising. Not quite halfway through “Freakadelic,” electronic processing is added to Johnson’s horn, and suddenly it’s as if it’s been beamed in from one ofJon Hassell’s imaginary worlds; then Bellerose doubles the tempo, adding a flurry of tumbling tom rolls. Toward the end of the piece it starts to break down, dissolving into a soup of hissy feedback and piled-up drums, but Parker’s harmonic taps continue ahead."

    "review_text": "From the second Timothée Chalamet gets spit out of a hitched ride at the edge of the George Washington Bridge in ragged clothes and a cabbie hat, clutching an acoustic guitar and a rucksack wandering the beat carnival on MacDougal Street,A Complete Unknownis, as the biopic form requires, a two-hour compression of music mythology that plays loose with facts. And every minute is a total blast. Digging straight into the exaggerated fable of howBob Dylan“went electric” at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 and drew a line and cast a curse—in two hours and dozens of eternal songs performed, at Chalamet’s insistence, live on set—A Complete Unknownis a pitch-perfect fiction made of history that will never stop changing.\nIf there is a moment inA Complete Unknownthat could move a Bobcat to tears, it comes in these opening scenes. After the young prodigy blown in from the Midwest cons a taxi driver into taking him to a New Jersey hospital to visit his ailing heroWoody Guthrie—the radical folk singer-songwriter 29 years his senior—Dylan plays an early original at his bedside. Performing “Song to Woody” for Guthrie and his one-time Almanac Singers bandmatePete Seeger, Dylan repurposes an ambling, bittersweet melody from Guthrie’s own “1913 Massacre.” The 20-year-old songwriter’s ode to his Dust Bowl North Star is an explicit act of carrying history forward, protecting Guthrie’s ethos of collectivity through autonomy, telling a previous generation you understand that which could have easily been unknowable in the future.\nDylan is not yet channeling Ginsberg but “Song to Woody” is Whitman through and through, transcending time by tracing it backward and forward. “Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men/That comeeee,” Chalamet sings, drawling the last syllable into a 10-second locked-eye stare, picking the guitar into a rolling low drone, “with the dust and are gone with the wind.” Hearing “Song to Woody” sung by the zillennial icon sends it towards its destiny: traveling on. It’s the closing track onA Complete Unknown’s soundtrack, but in the movie, it’s Chalamet’s first and only chance to convince us he can be Dylan, and he pulls it off: in his weary eyes, in his careful phrasing, in his unprecious trim of the lyrics, in the steadfast conviction of a guy with everything to prove.\nTo watch a Hollywood depiction of the most sanctified songbook in modern music—of the trickster, the prophet, the sage and liar, mainstream outsider, visionary pop poet, inspiration to the Beatles and the Black Panther Party, Nobel Prize winner—is a good time. (I saw Gerde’s Folk City in IMAX!) The songs carry the story. We don’t learn much about who Guthrie actually was besides in Dylan’s song about a world “that looks like it’s dyin’ and it’s a-hardly been born,” while the real stakes of the ’60s political contexts are mostly limited to a brief performance of “Masters of War.” The true mark left on Dylan by artist, activist, and red-diaper baby Suze Rotolo (named Sylvie Russo here at Dylan’s own request) feels thinly sketched inA Complete Unknown, but her impact on culture by way of introducing her then-boyfriend to the civil rights struggle and Brecht and Rimbaud are present in many of these folk standards, not least in the question marks X-raying our still depraved civilization in “Blowin’ in the Wind.”"

    "review_text": "For the longest time, I couldn’t quite understand what kept pulling me back toEndling, the fifth synthesizer album byDawn of MididrummerQasim Naqvi. Still, for weeks, I would press play whenever the day’s other listening seemed to be done, or when I was just too tired of the moment’s miasmic news to make another decision. Maybe, I thought, it was the references and echoes—how the title track wobbles like some vertiginousAlvin Lucierexperiment, how “Plastic Glacier” flutters like aBrian Enoouttake from Conny Plank’s studio in the late ’70s, how “In the Distance” bridges deep bass and noise filigrees likethe Haxan Cloaka dozen years ago. Or maybe, I reckoned, it was Naqvi’s impeccable timing, the way he moves among ideas with absolute surety, neither too rushed nor indulgent. How else could “Beautification Technologies” shift from haunted drone to heavenly synth arpeggios to some disorienting interzone in under five minutes? Maybe my attraction was purely technical.\nBut I recently happened to listen toEndlingduring a tense debate with an old friend about the day’s headlines. I finally understood why it felt so apt, beyond Naqvi’s textural and temporal capabilities: With society pushing against an existential brink, the album suggests a sanctuary, or any kind of third place—a coffee shop, a bar, a park bench—that holds space for conversational horror and hope, for an honest admission of how we feel and what we still want to be. This epiphany, turns out, shouldn’t have taken me so long. Naqvi builtEndlingas a kind of solo prequel toGod Docks at Death Harbor, which the BBC Concert Orchestra premiered in 2023. With its title and concept inspired by a phrase his wife remembered from a dream,God Docks at Death Harborimagines the Earth’s landscape long after humans have slipped off the planet.Endlingdocuments the tragic hero’s journey as the last of a species tries to hang on to humanity a bit longer. It is at once draining and uplifting, a terribly beautiful and beautifully terrible vision of self-made extinction.\nFor more than a decade, Naqvi has made grand tones feel subtle and suggestive. Inspired by his explorations of the ARP Odyssey, the voices on his 2014 choral album,Fjoloy, quiver so heavily that they seem to defy concepts of key and consonance, as if they are being pitch-shifted by the world’s very rotation. On 2016’sChronology, he exploited the faults of a failing Moog to move steadily upward through static skips and broken tones, like an angel rising through a rainstorm. And on his breakthrough album as a synthesist, 2019’sTeenages,he proved capable of conjuring dark and light, confidence and equivocation, as if documenting the process of defining oneself through six absorbing pieces."

    "review_text": "The most notable thing we know aboutBill Foxis that we know almost nothing notable about him, and that’s still more than he might like us to know. In the 1980s he fronted a short-lived but well-loved band called the Mice, whose brand of catchy, acerbic power pop inspiredElliott Smithand fellow BuckeyesGuided by Voices. He released a series of solo albums—like 1996’sShelter From the Smokeand 1998’sTransit Byzantium—that are considered beloved cult artifacts. Yet he has consistently torpedoed any opportunity to become more than a cult artist. He broke up the Mice on the eve of a national tour, and he responded to a major-label offer by becoming a recluse. Fans and a fewdoggedjournalistshave sought him out in Cleveland and even located him, but Fox responds with prickly pleas for privacy. He releases an album or two every decade, although it’s unclear whether he’s still writing and recording or has simply amassed a big enough back catalog to mete out as needed.\nFox is cult by choice, but his music is neither extreme nor especially idiosyncratic. He draws from familiar sources—California folk rock, Midwestern power pop, British Invasion—and he seems to be a fan ofDylan,Springsteen(in particularNebraska),the Beatles, maybeBig StarorCheap Trick. He traffics in popular touchstones rather than obscure references, as though he wants his songs to sound familiar and accessible: easy to grasp and easy to enjoy. The lo-fi sound quality lends them a living-room intimacy, unfussy and first-take casual. Usually cult artists are cult artists because their vision is too esoteric to appeal to more than a few, but this doesn’t seem to be the case with Fox. He may avoid contact with fans and press, but his music seems to be a means of reaching out; his songs express an intense desire to connect with the larger world. “Let me come before you, let me lose this weight,” he sings on “Desperation.” “Take my hand and understand, say it’s not too late.”\nThere’s no trace of reluctance or ambivalence onResonance, Fox’s first album in 13 years; it’s full of sharp lyrics, vivid imagery, crushing confessions, and endearing musical flourishes. Listen to the way Fox opens “My Servin’ Time” with a great rush of words, nimbly navigating the tricky rhythms and internal rhymes: “You’ve been grievin’ for me leavin’ and believin’ I’ll abandon you behind.” But also listen for that strange tape warble that punctuates the performance, as though Fox is recording to an old, warped cassette. Someone else might have scrapped that take, but Fox seems to appreciate the serendipity of the effect. The lo-fi setting might amplify the bitterness of “The Biggest Sale,” but it can also be close to magical. Some odd, unidentifiablesomethingadds a strident beat to the first of “Terminal Way”—it might be a box top or saucepan—and then the chorus reveals it to be a tambourine. Hearing that familiar jangle is like watching a sleight-of-hand trick."

Maintaining a steady 160 bpm pulse, she speeds through 20 tracks in just over 34 minutes, eschewing club music’s traditional build-ups and cooldowns to chain climax after climax. Even compared to the madcap sampledelia of her earlier work,!OK!is a constant stream of stimulation, pouncing on each opportunity to fuse a new, strange combination of samples from al Hanafi’s deep crates.\nAl Hanafi’s debut bears the influence of trips she’d take to France to visit her aunt, who lived above a record store. Because al Hanafi didn’t own a turntable, she developed a roundabout sample-hunting method, snapping photos of cool-looking LPs to listen to on her phone later. The sound ofSlime Patrolreflects this exchange between physical and digital worlds. Muffled mixing and jazzy instrumentation evoke the feeling of dropping the needle on a rare slab, while her affection for Atlanta trap a capellas and Nintendo DS soundtracks fold in her childhood fixations. Much of the appeal ofSlime Patrolstemmed from this time-warping, and while the stylish retrofuturism remains intact on!OK!, al Hanafi uses it as a foundation for greater compositional experimentation. She flickers the volume of melodies on and off to conjure sensations of weightlessness on tracks like “Roll Up (Lemme Show You)” and “Miss Him (Ma Baby).” A surprising use of jungle breaks makes “Borders” an exuberant experience. The bleeping, ringtone-era synth work on “Bounce It on the Flo” cuts through the mix to signal that al Hanafi’s taking a stab at juke traditionalism for two minutes of pure adrenaline. Each transition between tracks is a new opportunity to catch listeners completely off guard.\nOn “Bad Bitch on Your Side,” al Hanafi uses soft 808 tom drums to glue disparate yet surprisingly complementary pieces together. Vivisected bits of electric keyboard overlap to form impressionistic clusters of harmony. Two vocal samples—a line sourced fromNicki Minaj’sCall of Duty: Warzoneskin and a pitched-up excerpt from the lateUnk’s “Walk It Out”—converse over the elegant backdrop, creating an atmosphere that’s both bratty and baroque. The track is conducive to frenetic dancing, but it’s just as suitable for falling back onto the sofa as rippling arpeggios permeate the room. Al Hanafi’s use of starkly contrasting layers makes each listen feel like staring at a magic eye puzzle: just shifting your focus between frequencies can ratchet up the adrenaline or help you unwind."

    "review_text": "Remember “Smack a Bitch,” the rap-rock stomper in whichRico Nastythanked God that she didn’t have to slap the shit out of someone? When it dropped in 2018, it was a rallying cry for rap-rooted, emo-curious young people: an eclectic subset that bootlegged pop-punk songs, looked up toLil Peep, maybe fucked withParamore. This month, some of those angsty teenagers graduated from college; Thrasher beanies and discarded vape pens gather dust on their closet floors. This doesn’t make their past selves any less authentic—they’ve just grown up. Rico, too. Years ago, as a DMV upstart, she funnelled her influences—punk rock, swag-era pop, regional rap—into a glammed-up character that bordered on cartoonish. She wore her hair in spikes, favored platform boots, and created alter egos. Nearly a decade later, none of them fit anymore.\nThis is the premise ofLETHAL, the most wrathful and freewheeling Rico Nasty album to date. Released via pop-punk label Fueled by Ramen, the record attempts to ditch old constraints—costumes, identities, categories—in favor of unfiltered feelings. Those computer-generated guitars from “Smack a Bitch”? They’re live now. Sometimes the drums, too. Oh, and there’s a death metal song. “I’ve already been looked at as the big, angry, screaming bitch anyway,” she said in arecent interview. “So why the fuck would I care?” Somewhere in these 15 songs is the most hell-raising, heavyweight Rico Nasty album in years. But as much asLETHALseeks to do away with costume-play, the scattered cross-genre patchwork effectively makes competing caricatures of its influences—no longer melding rock with rap, but slipping in and out of them like changes of clothes. Tacobella and Trap Lavigne are not only still alive, they’re competing for space.\nThis tug-of-war makes for a disjointed listen, which sucks, because there are so many glimpses of the cutthroat album that could have been. In the first three tracks, Rico darts between redundant rage (“Who Want It”), arena-rock pastiche that would crush in a Nerf commercial (“Teethsucker (Yea3x)”), and one of the most affecting love songs in her catalog (“On the Low”). It’s the real thing: not the unfuckwithable Tacobella, nor the punk princess Trap Lavigne, but a yearning Rico Nasty setting aside braggadocio to promise that she won’t kiss and tell. The simmering “Eat Me!” attempts to subvert hypermasculine rage, turning feminine agency into authority. (Compare “He wanna fuck on a MILF, callin’ me mama” to “I’m fuckin’ on a MILF, yeah, ayy, this bitch like 30.”) The production is too monotonous to be convincing, and this leaves Rico on an island. Then there’s a sudden transition, and she’s shit-talking over a sputtering new beat that finally matches her energy. It’s vintage Rico Nasty, the bratty flexer that slid all overNastyin 2018. But it’s hard to appreciate, because it’s only half of the song.\nLETHALis, in spirit, a passion project: Rico Nasty sounds like she’s having a blast. Yet certain moments seem dropped in, as if to meet a rebellion quota. Midway through “Grave,” she raps, “Rocking shit like I rip on a guitar,” and—surprise!—a heavy guitar lick appears, like someone pressed aHard rock sound effectsbutton. The buzzsaw riffage of “Smoke Break” is a beautiful match for Rico’s raspy timbre, but the song is undermined by anti-everything clichés like “Break shit always” and “Burn this shit down”: rock music as anarchy ASMR. It’s too bad, because the album has highlights if you know where to look: “Can’t Win Em All” lobs a mellow alt-rock ballad over wonderfully shifty percussion; the foot-tappy “Crash” is disarmingly desperate, proof that Rico is more than just punchlines and persona. More often, the Rico Nasty ofLETHALfeels like she’s playing herself in a biopic: performing the most extreme version of a character she set out to deconstruct.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Jazz harpistBrandee Youngerwas gadding about herself when she discovered the word “gadabout” while on tour, traveling by day and reinventing compositions at shows with bassist-producer Rashaan Carter and drummer Allan Mednard by night. Dating to the early 19th century, the word describes one who goes from place to place in search of pleasure, prioritizing adventure and childlike delight. It was this relentless pursuit of professional and artistic satisfaction that inspired her newest record,Gadabout Season, a celebratory manifesto of self-adventure that blends New Age atmospheres with spiritual jazz spunk.\nTo be lauded as a successor to harp legends Dorothy Ashby andAlice Coltrane, as Younger has, is no easy feat; these women pushed the instrument into new territories, reframing how the harp can function in jazz ensembles and popular music at the height of the post-Bop era. Younger’s previous albums were indebted to them, withBrand New Life,her most convincing, full of interpretations of Ashby’s compositions. While Younger’s inspirations remain undeniable onGadabout Season—much of the album was recorded on Coltrane’s instrument—the album seeks to put some separation between the harpists and allow Younger to come fully into a compositional voice of her own. She has writing credits on every track, as if seeking to establish her legacy alongside her idols.\nDespite her expanded creative control as bandleader, Younger’s ensemble takes fewer risks than on prior albums.Brand New Lifewas all about bringing Ashby’s work into a contemporary context: “Livin’ and Lovin’ in My Own Way” featured boom-bap drums and record scratches for a unique blend of harp-driven hip-hop; “Dust,” withMeshell Ndegeocello, threaded Black diasporic music together, letting Younger’s harp flourishes fill the space between the dubby Caribbean reggae drums and Ndegeocello’s silky voice. Even if the hip-hop aspects felt slightly dated or the genre-blending a little heavy-handed, the question ofwhat if Dorothy Ashby made these songs today?was weighty enough to propel Younger toward new frontiers with an instrument that hardly gets enough love in popular music.\nGadabout Seasonfeels less ambitious in comparison, more concerned with meditative circularity than forward motion. Take the title track: It begins with a tasteful vamp, Younger’s tinny plucks dancing around Carter’s thick, inquisitive bassline. What seems like a perfect conduit for exploration is hindered by a rigid structure and brief runtime, leaving little room for unfamiliar ideas or virtuosic improvisation. Even the album’s lulling melodies feel somehow rushed, as if the ensemble had hoped to use music to induce a trance state in the audience but hit a quota on track length. Though the way Younger’s meticulous trills fade and reappear throughout the mellow “Reflection Eternal” is lovely, two minutes isn’t nearly enough time to truly sink into the dreamy atmosphere."

    "review_text": "Trying to fit all ofDaryl Johns’ influences into one box is a daunting task. Among the many inspirations for his self-titled debut album, he’s cited “Jessie’s Girl” and “Baba O’Riley”; emo andHüsker Dü;Fast Times at Ridgemont High; the ’60s, ’80s, and the hair, specifically, of the ’70s; burgers, shakes, and fries; and Mickey Mouse. To try to make sense of it all is to be a hapless Tony Montana standing before the mountain of blow on his desk, muttering, “We gotta get organized here.” Good luck with all that.\nDaryl Johnsbegan a decade ago as a series of unreleased songs when Johns, a classically trained upright bass player and jazz prodigy, got sick of playing standards and started noodling around with different genres, “quilting pop melodies together in a maximalist way,” as heputs it. And after signing with friend and famous chillerMac DeMarco’s label, Johns began experimenting with his own offbeat takes on indie rock. But it would be remiss to mistake the sum for its parts;Daryl Johnsis no pastiche, instead creating its own sprawling universe of loosey-goosey, feel-good jaunts. Painting modern landscapes in retro strokes, the album’s sound is uniquely fresh yet familiar in a million different directions.\nLead single “I’m So Serious” is the most synth-pop-inspired song on the album. In the neon-drenched music video, Johns leans full-tilt into MTV-style Americana, shredding in front of a Mel’s Drive-In (another inspiration he’s named: “diner rock”). While clever and definitely a banger, “I’m So Serious” is also the album’s most literal song, preferring to rehash its influences rather than delve into something stranger. Still, the winkingly self-referential lyrics in the bridge seem to serve as a sweeping introduction to the whole album: “Hit the EQ,” he yelps through the fourth wall. “Now ride the volume.”\nThrough the rest of the album, we learn that eclecticism is Johns’ chief strength. In “Barbecue in the Sun” and “Friends Forever,” he melds ’80s textures with ’60s pop forms, reverbing the hell out of his layered, DIY-Ronettes vocals. His fragmented lyrics evoke bits and pieces of roller-rink nostalgia—never outlining a clear scene, but creating vivid, blurry flashes of the fleeting moments before the lights come up. No wonder he’s described the album’s sound as “TV jingle memories.”\nOn the instrumentals (five out of 14; seven, if you count monosyllabic vocals as an instrument—and the way he writes them, I would), Johns gets to flex his jazz virtuosity more clearly while still maintaining the album’s carefree vibe. There are complex time signatures, modulations through the roof, a genuinely impressive number of solo showcases in which he plays no fewer than four instruments. But these songs don’t just highlight technical proficiency; they guide us through the album’s sweeping backdrop, the way a quirky setting informs the wackiness of its characters. Johns often renders the tones of each instrument as synthily as possible, zhuzhing up classic jazz foundations with an arcade-game sheen; the Tommy Bahama swing of “Crash” serves as a perfect example, evoking a Wii Sports Resort groove if the Mii community had more steez. And on more uptempo songs like “Palermo,” punchy, frenetic drums propel us into Mario Kart fervor."

    "review_text": "On “Through the Fire,” which has the type of soulful bounce Kanye West could have made forthe Gamein 2005, producer and rapper JasonMartin tellsLefty Gunplayhe understands the odds the Guatemalan American rapper has been up against since his 2022 release from prison: neighborhood rivalries, incarceration, PTSD, addiction. Lefty had been locked up in California’s notorious Pelican Bay supermax after stabbing an inmate at his former facility; it’s where he’d finish nine years out of an original 13-year sentence for shooting up a house party. JasonMartin tells Lefty that it’s now or never, that in the wake of Lefty’s surprise feature onKendrick Lamar’s platinum-selling “TV Off,” he’s now in a position to change the direction of his and his family's lives for good. Lefty, sounding frantic, responds that he’s never been more locked in.\nLefty’s new full-length,Can’t Get Right, a collaboration with executive producer, producer, and costar JasonMartin, is a first test of whether Kendrick’s handpicked choices for next in the West, via their inclusion on last year’sGNX, are panning out. Though technically Lefty’s fifth album, it reflects a rich tradition of cinematic and biographical West Coast gangsta rap debuts: ThinkDJ Quik’sQuik Is the Name, the Game’sThe Documentary, or Kendrick’s owngood kid, m.A.A.d city. Album opener “Lord Forgive Me,” co-produced by Scott Storch, begins with what sounds like a drive-by shooting—perhaps not unlike what Lefty heard on the night that sent him to prison for nearly a decade.\nThe album’s structure mirrors Lefty’s story, a whirlwind of shootouts, paranoia, brief but intense courtships, hotel parties, and the long stretches of solitude only found in prison. Under JasonMartin’s direction, the harrowing details unfold over production that revives the California G-funk both artists grew up on, though the results are a little clichéd and at times uneven. The raucous “Hotel Party” reminds me of the short and debaucherous “Let’s Get High,” fromDr. Dre’s2001. The album’s centerpiece is a remake of MC Eiht’s classic “Streiht Up Menace,” with the Game himself re-doing the hook nearly word-for-word. The beat has a little too much going on to match the stripped-down magic of its source material, and Lefty’s attempts to interpolate Biggie and Eminem practically beckons the listener to just play MC Eiht instead. His clunky attempt at a love song, “Heavens Above (My Angel),” flips the Amanda Perez classic “Angel” yet mostly evokes thegruffandperplexing chemistrybetweenJa RuleandAshanti."

And it’s not just the rappers—influencers are using old iPhones atrunway showsand have been “bringing wired headphones back” since the decade turned. The midpoint of the 2020s feels so aesthetically dependent on the past that its own cultural identity feels elusive. Sometimes this leads tocharming revivalism; other times we end up with whatever the fuckTumblr Musicis. Is everything just a reference of a reference?\nChicago’s thirteendegrees ° is a standout from the ongoing nostalgia parade, a rap game time traveler who probably watches106 & Parklike white 30-somethings watchFriends. He meticulously infuses his sound with early 2010s hip-hop touchstones and boasts historically accurate visuals to match: His cover art mirrorsG.O.O.D. MusicandA$AP Rocky, designed like CD jewel cases; apromo videofor his latest tape,Clique City Vol. 2, reimagines a throwback BET interview with kitschy CGI and snap-heavy R&B beats. “So what can the fans expect from you in 2025?” thirteen is asked in the video’s faux Q&A. “2025?” he retorts. “2015!” OnClique City Vol. 2, he builds on his archivist formula withSantigold-inspiredartworkand a dozen songs that remind me of how badly I used to want some YMCMB merch. He deftly adapts the victorious Boi-1da horns, robotic melismas, and classic soundbites; my favorite track, “Teardropz,” kicks off with Drumma Boy’s patented“Listen to dis track, bitch!”The gimmick works for him just as much as it works against him.\nLike a human Wayback Machine, thirteendegrees pulls from parts ofYoung Moneyand theSwagErathat had been left to die on broken webpages. His technical prowess is hard to ignore; he andLunchboxare today’s only Auto-Tune belters that can hold a candle toT-Pain. When I hear thirteen yelp “What’s wrong with demmm?” on “Digital Luv,” it instantly brings me back to “Chopped N Skrewed.” The radio R&B gloss of “Tumblr Modelz” is full of gems (despite its corny premise): the Zaytoven bells, the bop flourishes, the way the “B” in “bitches” detonates from his lips on the hook. But like his contemporaries, it’s near impossible to distill thirteendegrees’ identity outside of his influences. Sure, my childhood love forRebirthis vindicated by “Talkin 2 Much (Knockout),” a sappy, guitar-ledWayne&Nickirehash, but the track shows how well thirteen can build off a prompt rather than crafting something original. He also runs the risk of sounding too dated: The hellish brass and bass of “Chinchilla” recalls Tyga’sWell Doneseries—a watered-down version of the bangers Waka Flocka and Rick Ross were dropping in 2010.\nBut thirteen’s knack for harmonies and songwriting ultimately separate him from other acts in his lane. “I got cake/Teardrops on my face” he intones to open “Teardropz,” one layer of his vocals frigid and unperturbed as the other shoots past the stratosphere. thirteen’s adlibs reach similar heights on track two beside the most millennial radio-pop hook you’ll hear today: “Got a guilty pleasure/I love super hot girls.” (Welcome back, LMFAO.) Even the somber, aqueous symphony of “Heartlezz Sucka” is made more intoxicating thanks to his bionic coos and wails behind its wistful refrain. To close out certain songs, he gives himself an encore when the hook loops (“Sing that mothafucka!” he yelps on “Talkin 2 Much”). Despite his execution sometimes feeling contrived, thirteendegrees has all the tools to make a hit song for both today and yesterday. He’s nearly as funny and malleable as Young Thug, but it’s clear how much Lil Wayne’s reign plays a role in his approach. “I’m the best rapper alive, and you know that be facts, uh,” he spits. Self-belief is a good place to start—he just needs to bring us somewhere we haven’t seen before."

    "review_text": "In 2017, road crews working to remove a road sign in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, toppled the sign into traffic, causing lengthy backups—and inspiring an eyewitness report that has become a minorviral sensationover the years. One Philadelphia man,interviewed by a local CBS affiliate, looked up at the construction team’s flashes of light in the sky that night and, for a brief moment, saw the cosmos: “I thought it was a bunch of shooting stars,” he recalled, eyes wide. “I was making a bunch of wishes.”\nThat moment could be a lyric fromCaveman Wakes Up, the humbly exceptional fifth album from Philadelphia’s very ownFriendship. Across the record, the four members of the group sketch a starry-eyed map of the city: “I have chilled on that stoop before,” frontman Dan Wriggins sings on “Tree of Heaven,” as if memorializing a former battleground: “Nothing is forgotten.” On a song called “Love Vape,” he spends half a verse romanticizing a gas station off Locust Street that has the “cheapest cigarettes on Earth.” On “All Over the World,” he looks up at the sun while stoned at his landscaping job and feels “the beating heart of God.” If you stay long enough in one place,Caveman Wakes Upsuggests, you start to find warped profundity in the everyday.\nFriendship have spent the past decade finding cosmic meaning in the tangled metaphors of contemporary life. Over the course of the band’s discography, Wriggins has painstakingly examined aleatory minutiae, seeing the poetry in aramekin of leftover jelly, asix-pack of beer on the porch,the resilience of a pestering housefly. Fleeting emotional truths erupt from his baritone delivery like ants scattering from an overturned rock. With each album, the band’s tweaks to the indie-folk canon have steadily grown more complex and self-assured, from the lonely thud of a drum machine on 2017’sShock Out of Seasonto the stomp-clap rhythms and slow-burning melodies of their 2022 Merge debutLove the Stranger.\nAll the while, the band members’ individual pursuits have somewhat retroactively rendered Friendship a dirtbag Americana supergroup. Guitarist Peter Gill fronts the prolific power-pop revival act2nd Grade; percussionist Michael Cormier-O’Leary co-runs the Philadelphia labelDear Lifeand composes for the instrumental chamber-folk ensembleHour; bassist Jon Samuels plays in 2nd Grade, co-runs Dear Life with Cormier-O’Leary,andis the touring guitarist forMJ Lenderman. Wriggins, meanwhile, spent the past few years splitting his time between odd jobs and writing hisfirst book of poetrywhile pursuing an MFA at the Iowa Writers Workshop (“I woke up loving the sea. Enormous and full of garbage,” begins one typical entry).Caveman Wakes Upis a spit-shined culmination of the band’s collective powers, a ramshackle triumph that transforms gritted-teeth non sequiturs into unlikely anthems for the downwardly mobile."

    "review_text": "Stefan Kozalla is a peerless figure in a crowded field. Once theenfant terribleof Hamburg’s Golden Pudel club, the German producer made his name in the early aughts with anidiosyncratictakeon the bold colors and broad strokes of storied minimal-techno imprint Kompakt. He released one of the subgenre’s definitivelate-period recordson his own label—which became a fantastical sandbox for friends and fellow weirdos—then transcended it entirely on 2018’sKnock Knock, one of those Technicolor albums that renders real life sepia-toned by comparison. “It’s less competition to make music without the dancefloor in mind,” DJ Koze mused on arecent Resident Advisor podcast. “Not without reason, you have all these military terms: ‘You killed it!’ ‘It’s a weapon of mass destruction!’ ‘It’s a bomb!’” Rather than scaling EDM’s steep cliff face, he’s burrowed into it, carving out a hermitage in the stone.\nThat’s not to say there haven’t been setbacks. The enthusiasm aroundHit Parade, the 2023 LP Kozalla made with art-pop matriarchRóisin Murphy, cratered when transphobic remarks posted to the singer’s personal Facebook page were made public. Koze didn’t share an official statement at the time, but I can’t help but hear the first words spoken on his new album,Music Can Hear Us, in that context: “I would like to start with a quote from Rumi: ‘Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,/There is a field. I’ll meet you there.’”Hit Paradewas supposed to be his star-making moment as much as Murphy’s, the final stage in a transmutation from eccentric dancefloor wizard to global pop savant. It’s taken a couple extra years, but Koze has finally arrived:Music Can Hear Usis a giddy collision of good taste and whatJohn Waterscalled “good bad taste,” brought into harmonious coexistence by an artist whose greatest asset is his inextinguishable supply of curiosity and childlike wonder.\nFollowing its brief foray into Sufi theology, seven-minute album opener “The Universe in a Nutshell” unfolds like a guided meditation as whorls of trilling violin and wordless hums sprout from a reverberant tabla pattern. Koze layers glockenspiel, chimes, and all manner of whimsical noise, but in his typically pranksterish fashion, the track culminates not in a beat drop—there are few to be found anywhere on the record—but with a harpsichord riff descended from the Brothers Johnson’s cover ofShuggie Otis’ “Strawberry Letter 23.” Like the cut-upBeach BoysstylingsofPanda Bear, this is pop music whittled down to just the best parts, a box of Lucky Charms that’s only marshmallows. “Tu Dime Cuando” pulls off a similar sleight of hand, conjuring a phantom bolero out ofSofia Kourtesis’ sing-songy hook."

    "review_text": "To really die you have to die three ways.Townes Van Zandtdiscovered this after overdosing on model airplane glue. He was declared DOA at the hospital where, to hear him tell it, he sat for an hour and a half while doctors debated just how dead he was. “There’s brain death, which I’ve suffered. There’s respiratory death, which I haven’t suffered yet. And there’s heart death, which I go through every two or three months,” he told filmmaker James Szalapski. “But I figure if you’re ever all three of those at once, that’s it. That’s the ballgame.”\nVan Zandt died more than most because he lived more than most. He reasoned that to write great songs, he would have to experience everything that he could survive and a few things he couldn’t. As a freshman at the University of Colorado at Boulder, he tipped backward over the railing of a fourth-story balcony just to see how it felt to lose control. “I started leaning back really slow, and really paying attention,” he recalled to journalist William Hedgepeth. “I fell over backwards and landed four stories down flat on my back. I remember the impact and exactly what it felt like and all the people screaming.” This kind of thing makes for a good story but a turbulent life. Van Zandt kept his balance between chaos and calm for as long as he could, but he always knew which way he would fall.\nWhatever fame Van Zandt achieved was very nearly accidental. He went along, in a limited way, with the machinations of the music industry, recording six remarkable albums in five years between 1968 and 1972. Almost despite himself, he was on the verge of a breakout success with his seventh record, to be calledSeven Come Eleven. Recorded in the spring of 1974, it was meant to build on his considerable momentum and launch him onto the national stage. However, the album would not be released for nearly 20 years. By the time it hit shelves in 1993, now titledThe Nashville Sessions, Van Zandt was a cult figure, a songwriter’s songwriter better known for other artists’ covers of his work. Rather than a career-defining album,Seven Come Elevenhad become a footnote in a tragic story.\nVan Zandt came from a reputable family. Townes Hall at the University of Texas is named after one side and Van Zandt County, outside of Dallas, after the other. His father was high up in the oil industry and his mother wanted Townes to be a lawyer or a politician or an oil man himself. Van Zandt mainly wanted to get drunk and hit the road. After the balcony stunt, Townes got a friend to forge a letter to the dean excusing him from the rest of the semester and hitchhiked to Oklahoma and back. Upon learning of this behavior, his parents flew up to Boulder, took him out of college, and put him in a psychiatric hospital in Galveston, where he received a combination of insulin coma therapy and electroshock therapy. At the time, this method was at the cutting edge for his diagnosis of “schizophrenic reaction.” A side effect of the three-month-long treatment was the erasure of his long-term memory. Afterward, he had to be reintroduced to his mother: She was the one with the long hair."

    "review_text": "For a dance music producer,Anthony Napleshas always made albums with unusually broad appeal—the kind that even your coworker who went to aFour Tetshow once might appreciate. Each LP has some kind of unifying theme or inspiration, like ’90s downtempo onOrbs,nighttime radio onFog FM, or the surprising inclusion of live instruments onChameleon,an experiment in writing music, rather than producing it.Scannersstands out for its lack of context or backstory. Even the accompanying note onBandcampmerely says that it features “ten new songs.” The New York artist’s sixth album is his most straightforward yet: ten new songs indeed, exploring a subtle and spacious take on dance music with polished surfaces and just the right amount of melody. No experiments, no interludes, no left turns, yet it works from front to back nearly as well as any of his more artsy records.\nIt’s instructive that Naples uses the terms “songs” rather than “tracks.”Scannersis uniform—each track has the same structure and comes in at an average of around six minutes—but Naples approaches them all with a songwriterly touch, as on the pumping “Night.” On the surface, “Night” is almosttribal house, that most functional of subgenres, with a pots-and-pans drum pattern that moves horizontally like a crab scuttling across the sand. But there’s so much more going on underneath, including a choppy melody that weaves around dramatic chord stabs, and a liberal application of effects that makes the tracks feel live. A texture is always changing, the filter envelope is always on the move. A sound rarely stays the same for more than a few bars in Naples’ music.\nWhen it comes to sound,Scannersis one of Naples’ supplest records. The tracks feel unusually roomy; the huge kick drums are EQ’d way down, so that they mostly occupy the lowest frequencies. That leaves the midrange open for squelchy acid-style basslines and clay-putty chords on “Ampere,” or fuzzed-out leads on “Mushy”—which lands somewhere between trance and electroclash—or jaunty keyboards on the cutesy “Somebody.” That one reminds me of old tracks like “Mad Disrespect” or “Abrazo,” but with a newfound sense of humor. There’s a level of exaggeration in the way the piano twinkles, stretches, and wobbles that reminds me of artists on the classic minimal label Perlon (say,Markus Nikolai).\nThe hulking rhythm section, which isScanners’ most modern touch, betrays what is actually some of the most intricate material in Naples’ discography. There’s an attention to detail and chic sound design that feels very late ’00s—again, Perlon. The opening title track sounds a lot likeHuerco S.’s fantastic 2024 mnmlthrowback LPunder the aliasLoidis—sleek and vaguely iridescent, with a sound that resembles nothing in the real world yet brings to mind snatches of luxury. Think a cocktail bar, or a dark, neon-lit lounge, a portal to the dance music universe of the past when cool, globally influential parties happened onMonday nights in the Meatpacking Districtinstead of warehouses in Maspeth and Ridgewood. From the quirky piano on “Somebody” to the punchy, minimalist house of “Compact,” this music will either read as timeless or retro, depending on how long you’ve been in the game. Either way, it hits."

    "review_text": "A few years after Atlanta oddballSahBabiibroke out with his 2017 hit “Pull Up wit ah Stick”, he kept the momentum going with witty, absurd bars and a penchant for saying things like, “Gave her both of these balls like LaMelo and Lonzo.” But after the passing of a close friend, DemonChild, SahBabii dropped his shenanigans to create the 2021 LPDo It for Demon, a heartfelt memorial addressing grief and anguish. Though his rapping was still loose and nonchalant, he redirected his observations inward. On his new album,Saaheem, titled after his birth name, he balances mischief with vulnerable introspection, embracing minty-fresh vocal styles and sharpened production choices that highlight his songwriting.\nSahBabii is focused on telling all onSaaheem, even when it’s difficult—or ridiculous. In the first verse of “Belt Boyz,” Sah sounds more paranoid than ever, recalling witnessing DemonChild and his brother T3 do drive-bys. In both content and autobiographical style, it’s a clear extension ofDo It for Demon. “Save iT 4 Me Babii” tells a story of Sah taking an airplane to lay it down on a lover; you can almost envision the cartoon bubble above the window seat revealing his freaky daydreams: “It’s about two hours on this flight/Did you take a shower, get right?” It’s a perverted flashback that would be at home onBarnacles, but with a more studied approach. ThroughoutSaaheem, humor punctuates and softens weightier issues. On the piano-led “Everyday,” SahBabii’s tone swaps between serious and unserious as he runs through his day: “I hit a lick in the morning/Then I bought a sausage biscuit.” He finds beauty and humor in the real-time struggle, with an inclination for fun that makes even the gnarly moments come off endearing.\nWhen SahBabii takes stabs at styles he hasn’t explored much, it generally pays off. On “Viking,” he raps with a new intensity, a nasally inflection halfway betweenBarter-eraYoung ThugandI Am Music-eraPlayboi Carti. It aligns his sound more distinctly with the Atlanta canon and speaks to a love and understanding of the city he comes from. The Auto-Tuned melodies on “1095 Osborne St” are covered in clouds of silk, as if Luther Vandross was off prescription pills. It’s sexy, desperate, and hilarious, perfectly capturing his years-long obsession with making sex as silly as possible.\nPerhaps it’s the stylish production that brings out the best in Sah. Usually burdened by poor vocal mixing techniques, he sounds like a true professional onSaaheem, his vocal chains crisper than before. The beat selection abandons his usual run-of-the-mill atmospheric cuts for grittier selections that bring the drums to the forefront. “Sylvan Rd Ridin Down Dill,” one of the best beats on the album, features hallucinogenic synths, sticky 808s, and an absolutely disgusting snare sound. The sporadic 808 pattern on “Anaconda Living” sounds like rolling thunder through the hi-hats. “Don Quan Intro” lands with the introspective weight of aNothing Was the SameB-side: SahBabii bars up over the floaty instrumental, emphasizing the placement of the punchlines the same wayDrakewould. Other than a few tracks like “Roll Wit Me” and “Kodak” that are comparable to his usual fluff, Sah’s working with a new palette, and all the moving parts keep him focused."

Picture it: An electronic band at the vanguard of technology and sound—anchored by an enigmatic hunk married to the woman who produced their earliest albums—offloads his machines to meditate on a few very obvious Biblical passages. He and his friends move not only to the piano (he was, rumor had it, once a prodigy) and electric guitar but also a clutch of relatively esoteric instruments, at least as far as rock goes—tambura, oboe, violin, even a harpsichord.\nTheir dreamy songs are long, interwoven, and repetitive, invoking a cathedral walled with mirrors. The band is German, while its singer is a South Korean soprano, a refugee whose father was recently kidnapped by his native country on suspicions of espionage. What’s more, this new project took its name from key concepts in Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism, fitting for a band that took its own handle from a sacred Mayan text that the aforementioned hunk saw as a skeleton key for a life of discovery. Atadheavy-handed, huh?\nHalf a century ago, though, ideas of “world music,” conscious cross-cultural collaboration, and ethereal rock renderings of sacred religious texts barely existed, let alone enough to elicit exhausted groans. OnHosianna Mantra,Popol Vuhhelped invent them all.\nThe West German band had been floating amid the strong currents of the international psychedelic movement, still taking shape by the early 1970s. From the Haight-Ashbury afterglow to the Tropicália buzz of Brazil, from the radicalproggof Sweden to the anarchic underground of Japan, disconnected pockets of musicians around the world were collectively sounding out tides of political unrest and personal liberation. Germany was an essential locus of this activity, of course—the magnetic repetition ofKraftwerk, the lysergic trances of Ash Ra Tempel andNeu!, the barely controlled chaos ofCan. Vivid dioramas of synthesizers and percussion, Popol Vuh’s first two albums—1970’sAffenstundeand 1971’sIn den Gärten Pharaos—made them contemporaries with many groups from their country and abroad.\nButHosianna Mantraseemed to emerge from a different world altogether, a place where pondering wisdom, truth, and beauty were the real reasons to exist, not just something rock’n’roll kids did in the hazy hours after the party had ended.Hosianna Mantra’s graceful tones, slow motion, and gentle arc were not alien to Popol Vuh’s domestic kosmische scenes or to the global psychedelic puzzle; they were, however, mostly the stuff of prologue, epilogue, or interstitial bits that tied together records that ultimately turned toward rock."

    "review_text": "It was an extreme time; it was a normal time. In the weeks and months after the World Trade Center attacks, as the country’s mourning fermented and people became drunk with vengeance,TV on the Radio’sTunde AdebimpeandDavid Andrew Sitekhad to figure out how to return to work. “If we’re going to die,” Adebimpe told Lizzy Goodman years later, inMeet Me in the Bathroom, “we should probably just make a ton of shit that we like first.” By the time they released their debut album,Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes, in 2004, Adebimpe and Sitek—now joined by singer and guitaristKyp Malone—had found a way to make the shit they liked. But they never forgot about dying.\nNow reissued for its 20th anniversary with a collection of demos and singles,Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babesis an album in which extremes—of sound, of emotion, of thought—are tamed and normalized, even beautified, until their extremity becomes so routine you can take it for granted. Bass tones that rumble with the shake of an idling Harley are looped into terse quantized rhythms. Guitars that sound like synthesizers or distant drones swoop gracefully across the songs. Only three songs have live drums; the only cymbal is a hi-hat. Malone pushes his voice to the very top of his register and stays there, following Adebimpe’s lead vocals from above like a guardian angel. And Adebimpe, possessor of one of the greatest voices of his generation, sings with the urgency and desperation of someone who’d been asleep for a long time and has woken up to find his house on fire.William Basinski’sThe Disintegration Loops, which came out around the same time, captured the feeling of horrible possibility that 9/11 made apparent: The world was bigger than we thought, and that was a tragedy.Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babesis about what it feels like to live with this knowledge. “All your dreams are over now,” Adebimpe and Malone sing in “Dreams,” after warning, “But your heart can’t grieve.”\nThis dynamic, of trying to create joy and meaning in a hostile world, is something Adebimpe and Malone—as well as touring bassist Gerard Smith and drummer Jaleel Bunton, both of whom would soon become full-time members—would have to confront every time they stepped on stage as Black musicians in an overwhelmingly white scene.Desperate Youthopens on Adebimpe finding himself in “a magic n— movie” in “The Wrong Way,” where he reflects on the role that Black artists are so often forced to play: “Teaching folks the score/About patience, understanding, agape, babe/And sweet, sweet amour.”"

    "review_text": "Even from an initial scan of the tracklist, it’s clear thatDisciplineis a different kind ofShinichi Atobealbum. The Japanese producer usually scatters numbered sequences of tracks out of order across his records, suggesting a small selection from a vastAphexianarchive whose scale we can only guess at. “Ocean 1” and “Ocean 7” turned up on 2020’sYes,for instance, but “Ocean 2” didn’t appear until 2022’sLove of Plastic,and if there are more in the series, we’ll have to wait to hear them.Discipline,meanwhile, is a finite sequence: “SA DUB 1” through “SA DUB 8,” each track in the right order, each bearing the weight of the 46-minute album roughly equally. No cryptic interludes, no dead ends, nothing remotely as strange as “Rain 6,” from hisPeace of MindEP just three months ago: just eight rock-solid variations on a theme that add up to something more likeDonato Dozzy’sausteregenreexercisesthan Atobe’s usual rabbit holes.\nDisciplinehomes in on a specific sound, debuted earlier this year on “Dub 6(six),” the B-side of a limited-edition single for DDS: a midpoint between the dub techno of Atobe’s earlier releases and the sunnier house sound he’s been moving towards since 2018’sHeat.The term “dub techno” typically implies a rainy, vaporous strain of music that often drifts into pure ambient abstraction; Atobe’s worked in this mode before, most notably on his canonicalShip-ScopeEPfrom 2001, but this is a different interpretation of what those two words can mean in tandem.Disciplineis less interested in creating a sense of space, which is usually the starting point for techno producers appropriating techniques from Jamaican dub, than in using delay to create rhythmic interest. It’s moreBCD-2thanBCD: Atobe threads spiderwebs of echo between his pistoning house chords as robust drum patterns pump away, and the only “ambient” track, “SA DUB 5,” just sounds like an acid house track with the drums snipped out.\nAtobe’s been posting a lot ofSmithsvideos on Twitter lately, and his keyboard sounds reveal his romantic tendencies. “SA DUB 8” is embellished by rosy Yamaha DX-7 arpeggios seemingly ripped from an ’80s adult-contemporary ballad, while the gorgeous echoing piano that’s become something like Atobe’s signature works overtime on “SA DUB 7.” “SA DUB 5” might not be as woozy or mysterious as some of Atobe’s earlier beatless tracks, but each individual chord blossoms like a time-lapse of a budding flower as a ticklish TB-303 floats deep in the mix. Little staticky rustles and hisses find their way into the spaces between the drums, and every now and then we hear brief samples of female voices that sound like they were recorded through a phone speaker held up to a mic. These idiosyncratic touches bring variety and a splash of sentimentality to a record that might otherwise come off as a formal experiment.\nIn the past, Atobe’s music often proceeded from an alien logic. At its most extreme (2014’sButterfly Effect,2016’sWorld), his music sounds more like something naturally formed, or washed up on a beach, than made by human hands. Atobe’s press-shyness and the 13-year gap betweenShip-ScopeandButterfly Effecthave only fueled his mystique, leading to speculation about when (and even by whom) the music on his post-hiatus releases was made.Disciplinestrips away any such mystery, displaying his music’s logic up on the board for all to see. There’s nothing here that seems to have made its way into the music by accident, and the record is happy to stake out a small patch of musical territory rather than proceeding from the apparently unlimited thickets of Atobe’s imagination. But within these narrow parameters is a riot of skill and invention, with just enough of a glimpse into the obsessions of the man behind the music to make it feel like Atobe’s most personal record yet."

It’sKen Carsongrunting over synths thatslash like guillotinesandJane Removershrieking against a wall ofshuddering noise, the kind of rap that borders on maximalist EDM. Now there’s L.A. producer-performerLucy Bedroque, whose mixtapeUnmusiquesmashes into the fray so deliriously that some fans are saying it’s what they wishedCarti’sMUSICsounded like.\nBut Lucy isn’t a Carti clone nor someone who’d likely identify under the “rage” banner. Hespawnedin the SoundCloud underworld, orbiting scenes like sigilkore and the collective GREED—adust bowlof sickly, dissonant rap. With their old collaborator kaystrueno, Lucy pioneered “maplekore,” the duo’s nickname for an impressionistic sound inspired by the aughts South Korean MMORPGMapleStory. What distinguished their music, especially on the cult tapeSISTERHOODand their 2024 EPFête de la Vanille, was its tantalizingly flowery, near pastoral textures. The mixes are crunchy—dated and degraded like an mp3 lost on an old hard drive, but with a dewy twinkle. Imagine mosh music for a Jane Austen regency ball, rap as pretty as a forest glade swishing in the wind. Everything had a conceptual bent: There was a character named Glutmother; “sisters” that made up different emotional sides of Lucy Bedroque, struggling to unite in harmony.\nThere’s still some of that delight here, like “Cara Mia,” a wistful jaunt that sounds like a cross betweenEcco2kand a computer sputtering as if it had been infected by malware. But for the most part, the mixtape sacrifices the fairy-sprite frailty that gave Lucy Bedroque an edge. Instead,Unmusiqueunleashes some of the most turbocharged rap of the rage era.\nThis is Lucy’s first release with a label—deadAir Records, where he’s sonically at home next to people like Jane and kuru—and it’s got some of his cleanest mixes to date. Highlight “Ultraviolet” smacks like a supersize Sprite’s worth of sucrose, with wave after wave of synthy sweetness. He hits a delicious stride on “2010 Justin Bieber,” locking into the beat like it’s a piece of armor. With such acrobatic vocals, it’s a struggle to parse some of the lyrics, which makes it tempting to treat them as pure sound. But inch closer and, between the textbook flexes and “she wanna eat me up like pasta” filler, it’s hard not to crack a grin. He disses 25-year-old vampire cosplayers and laughs at his friend for “seeing baphomet off that fake Runtz”; he declares that he can beat Michael Jackson in a danceoff and convince the notoriously enigmatic and prolific fan-hater Izaya Tiji to love his supporters."

    "review_text": "Fadi Tabbal’s music has always been a dialogue. Since establishing Beirut’s Tunefork Studios in 2006, the Lebanese record producer and multi-instrumentalist hasrecorded countless recordsfrom the city’s independent music scene and played in bands ranging from prog rock to dream pop. Yet when it comes to his solo projects, he maintains that dialogue with himself, layering electric guitar and droning synths in an introspective cross betweenStars of the LidandUltrafog. “It’s a conversation really, between who you are, who you could be/have been, and who you want to be,” hesaidin 2014 after releasing his first record. On his latest album,I recognize you from my sketches, Tabbal brings the scene he’s been so indispensable in building into his solo work, sampling his peers in his most texturally diverse record yet.\nTabbal’s fascination with sound came early, growing up with Lebanon’s inconsistent electrical grid, where the hum of household appliances would modulate alongside power surges to create an infrastructural orchestra that has stayed with him since. These influences bear themselves out in the low, pulsating whir of “(keep beating),” as synths stream overhead like rays of light in a dusty cathedral. While Tabbal’s previous albums made these mechanical textures musical by layering them with patient drones, he applies them here to new experiments in space, repetition, and rhythm: Listen to the swells of static between sparse metallic loops on “You were right,” or the shapeshifting buzz that seeps to the surface on “Oh heart, are you burning.”\nI recognize you from my sketchesalternates between distortion and clarity, as if outlining the contours of an internal debate. Tracks like “When we swam together!” and “All those nights” are remarkably limpid, glassy synth tones dappled with twinkling piano impressions that offer respite from anxious soundscapes like “(keep thumping).” These ruptures are intentional; after years of mediating between others, Tabbal seems to reflect on lofty dreams and missed potential in a city infamous for its contradictions. So when he says this is a “breakup album between who we want to be and who we turned out to be,\" the use of the plural “we” feels like an intentional slippage.\nAs such, his reworking of samples from Beirut contemporaries marks an important shift in Tabbal’s solo work. Though he’s an inveterate collaborator, Tabbal rarely features others in his desolate ambient compositions; 2020’sSubject to Potential Errors and Distortions, which featured the voice of Julia Sabra, was a rare exception but perhaps a harbinger. He brings in Sabra again here, alongside Charbel Haber, Sharif Sehnaoui, Pascal Semerdjian, Anthony Sahyoun, Marwan Tohme, and Ghassan Sahhab, but their contributions are difficult to trace; the repeated, ascending riff on “Absence or death” might be Ghassan Sahhab’s qanun, manipulated into a cascading wash of delay that sounds like a more organic version of Boris’sFlood."

    "review_text": "Instead of a family Bible, Anna McGarrigle once reckoned, the McGarrigle children had their father Frank’s old arch-top Gibson guitar. It was one of the few possessions he brought into his marriage to Gaby Latrémouille in 1935. The French Canadian Irish couple inscribed the body of the instrument with the names of their friends as well as landmark milestones. Their daughters evolved the tradition. Their eldest, Janie, added the names of her friends, but also, as a child of the fledgling rock’n’roll era, “ELVIS.” The second, Anna, added her own icon, although misspelled: “DOUANE” as in Eddy, but also as in import “customs” in French, her first written language.\nIt was on this instrument that trailblazer Jane, cautious Anna, and the youngest, willful Kate, learned their first chords from Frank, Anna writes inMountain City Girls, a memoir co-authored with Jane after Kate’s death in 2010. Born in 1899, their father expected them to be able to play for company on the family’s 11 beat-up instruments, among them an accordion left as penance by a local drunk whom Frank brought home one night, to Gaby’s displeasure. He would bribe them a nickel to learn a song by the Gershwins, or the Romantic parlor songwriter Stephen Foster, or Hoagy Carmichael. Gaby kept sheet music for popular ballads and showtunes. The French Catholic nuns at convent school in Saint-Saveur-des-Monts, in the Laurentians north of Montreal, taught them solfège and chorales, and Jane drilled them all in harmony. The girls discovered the Everly Brothers andJoan Baezand, later, blues pioneer Ma Rainey and Bahamian guitarist Joseph Spence. Baez, in particular, became their role model, showing Kate and Anna—a natural double act born just 14 months apart—that a girl’s place in music wasn’t limited to buying the boy rockers Cokes after watching them play. She also imbued them with particular standards for their first instruments. Gifted brand new guitars on Christmas 1961, the teenagers turned up their noses and exchanged them for the cheap nylon-stringed versions that Baez favored.\nFrom there came their first vocal trio, with a girl who’d heard Kate singing at their new school after the family moved to Montreal. Soon after, Kate and Anna became part of the Mountain City Four, a folk outfit that sometimes had up to 10 members. While their stage presence was sloppy, the other members were dead serious about developing their interpretations, playing songs learned from the Library of Congress and Folkways, or those ofBob Dylan. When he went electric, so did they. (Anna was at Newport in 1965, and loved it.) If such great songs already existed, these purists reasoned, there was no need to write more, even—or perhaps especially—if Dylan was turning out new standards at a clip. But when Kate moved to New York City in 1969, as part of a duo with guitarist Roma Baran, she hit the Gaslight and Gurdy’s Folk City and various hootenannies, and discovered singer-songwriters showing off original material. She phoned Anna:We could do this too!"

    "review_text": "In 2023,Cantywas working on a somber dance-pop hymn called “Mirrorball” when they lost feeling in their legs. A doctor explained the mechanics behind the alarming turn, a sudden onset of multiple sclerosis. Canty’s spinal cord, the doctor said, was like a coated cable under attack by their own immune system. The description echoed a mantra Canty had been writing for “Mirrorball,” a song that alludes to “cables in my spine” and a crying bedside companion. It was a “harsh irony,” theywroteupon the song’s release, “like I’d got trapped inside the tune or some shit.”\nDim Binge, the East London singer-producer’s promising debut mixtape, feels eerily attuned to this cosmic resonance. “Trapped inside the tune” is just how Canty sounds within their own productions, blankets of ethereal fog pierced by a voice that writhes up like a stalk striving for sunlight. Their claustrophobic escapism shares a kinship with dance music, yet seems, at the same time, designed to cocoon against a world that demands decisive action and movement. Here is a place to wallow and rest; come inside, see if you like it too.\nDim Bingemakes for an enveloping sanctuary, but is more intriguing for its thorns of textural and harmonic dissent. At its best and worst, the mixtape owes a debt toThom Yorke, particularly his solo work’s olde folk cadences, beseeching soul swoons, and burnt-syrup glaze of ambient electronics. An instrumental called “blah blah blah” plays to Canty’s less engaging tendencies, swaddling strummed chords in diminished, vibe-heavy trip-hop; its twin is the sensational “hahaha,” presented here as a live recording that swaps navel-gazing atmospherics for the wonky, vaudevillian flair ofIn Rainbows Disc 2. “St Marks,” sprightlier still, lands just the right side of summer-festival fodder. Canty hurtles between louche croak and wounded wail, ducking in and out of the song’s largesse like an uncertain collaborator in their own melodrama.\nA tug-of-war between the epic and miniature plays out across the mixtape. Celestial anthems like “Follower” suggestSampha-scale ambition, but Canty often settles into a stealthier mode, lacing whispered dirges with strings that unsettle rather than stir. There are haunted ditties like “Pipps Hill” and “Estuary Pig”; the piano ballad “Mercy Street,” lamenting the cruel conditions of modern Britain; and an eerie cover ofArthur Russell’s “Being It” that would be cloyingly faithful, were it not for a gorgeous guitar motif seemingly exhumed from aDunedin soundpower-pop song.\nParticularly in the UK, Russell’s lunar minimalism has become a North Star to post-dubstep producer-songwriters in theJames Blakemold, indebted to the sensual tone but not the libido of contemporary R’n’B. Their strand of bedroom pop is full of Arctic mist and pregnant pauses, always raising its hand before making a point. The music tends to capture Russell’s amniotic alienation but misses his disconcertingoffness. With the exception of “hahaha,” Canty’s melodies are precise, their intonation measured, lyrics stubbornly poetic, with flares of passion parcelled into little vocal embellishments. Something about it suggests a search for beauty within a psyche on the verge of ruin. While the contrast creates a tonal tension, some life force feels lost in the refinement process, some rage or dysfunction withheld.Dim Bingeis a darkly beautiful record, but it makes me curious to hear Canty burst out of the cocoon and emerge a little uglier."

The ancient, lyre-like instrument—documented in some form as far back as the Homeric age—must instead be exposed to the elements, where a passing gust of wind will cause its strings to vibrate. Untouched nature is the 21st century’s ultimate luxury good, but it’s also hard to come by, soKassian’s Joe Danvers-McCabe and Warren Cummings have given us the next best thing. On its debut album, the UK electronic duo taps into the storied British tradition of cutting loose in the Mediterranean: starched white towels, fresco-tiled pools, yachts gliding into hidden coves. Toggling between house, techno, and Balearic beat,Channelsmoves with all the unforced ease of water finding its path of least resistance to reach the ocean, a record whose compulsive listenability belies a wealth of taste, complexity, and sophistication. It takes a lot of effort to sound this unbothered.\nAfter the electroacoustic table-setting of album opener “Mockingbirds,” Danvers-McCabe and Cummings kick off a first act that plays like the musical equivalent of day-to-night dressing. The breezy “Aeolian Harp” glimmers with morning sunlight, its funky walking bassline—a whisper ofChic’sRisqué— as invigorating as a shot of freshly pulled espresso. “Invision” pans down to the beach, where things are starting to heat up with a more muscular groove and blocky house chords that yearn for a ’90s soul diva to start wailing atop them, à laBlack Box’s 1990 opusDreamland. By the time we reach the neon-lit techno of “Metro” (a title and song that evoke, whether intentionally or not, the cosmopolitan boogie ofMetro Area), it doesn’t take much effort to picture the mirrorball sparkling overhead. And after what feels like 12 hours spent on the dancefloor,Channels’ title track offers a much-needed comedown: a downy bed ofItalo disco, wistful cello, and featherlight micro-electronic touches.\nTo widen their sonic eddies, Kassian brought in Timothy Kraemer, whose cello lines weave throughout the album, alongside jazz keyboardist andEzra Collectivemember Joe Armon-Jones. Armon-Jones’ keys shine on “Aeolian Harp,” where they bubble like air from a scuba mask rising to the surface, while Kraemer lends gravitas to the ambient washes of “Spring,” bringing to mind the tidal force ofFennesz’sAgora. The B-side triptych of “Sun,” “Joss Bay,” and “Sunset Park,” meanwhile, are all about Cummings and Danvers-McCabe, putting the duo’s previous flirtations with808 State-style acid house—as on last year’sSupercontinentEP—front and center. “Joss Bay” is the standout of the three, making canny use of a single-syllabic vocal sample that could be heard as either “Hey!” or “Wait!” It’s a fitting encapsulation ofChannels’ core tension: whether to treat the record as headphones music or body music. In Kassian’s hands, both options are pretty irresistible."

Her mirror raps prod and nudge rather than flatter, but the bluntness is galvanizing—she still makes it out the house.\ndo it afraidchronicles the labor of finding and holding onto joy, swinging from cheery dance cuts to yearning R&B to slick raps. The Queens-born, Brooklyn-based singer, rapper, and producer has long straddled emotions and genres, but this record is consciously sprawling and liquid, the flux matching her wavering resolve. Prioritizing atmosphere over narrative, Yaya spends the album pushing herself to overcome her fears and hang-ups. Wherever love can be found, she wants to be there, singing its praises, enraging her haters, and “throwing that ass around,” as she purrs on “in a circle.”\nYaya helms the bulk of the production, assisted byBADBADNOTGOOD, Nigel Hall, and various members of Virginia jazz fusion bandButcher Brown. The arrangements cycle through keys, strings, and horns, with percussion that patters and sways more often than it knocks.

Her broken heart becomes a bottomless well on “raisins,” a fuzzy neo-soul joint. “Fill it up, fill it up/With everything I dreamed of,” she implores, her voice melting into the piano chords. On “real yearners unite,” she showers a lover with praise, floating over what sounds like a sample of a zither orguzheng. “As the sun sets on your skin, I can’t think of a single place I’ve been/That’s better than right now,” she swoons.

Legendary BBC DJJohn Peelwas an early supporter of the British band, which was one of the key acts in the transition from punk to indie, with a fey, melodic guitar-pop style that proved influential on the UK’s C86 bands and beyond. Television Personalities recorded a session for Peel’s show in August 1980; those four songs kick off this new compilation,Tune In, Turn On, Drop Out – Radio Sessions 1980-1993. Also included is a session for the BBC’s Andy Kershaw from 1986; 10 songs recorded live for Cambridge, Massachusetts, station WMBR in 1992; and, as a bonus download, six songs recorded for New Jersey’s WFMU in 1993.\nThe appeal of a radio session is often to hear a band’s songs stripped of their more elaborate production choices. At the BBC, bands typically get a few hours to lay down three or four tracks, and there is no time for faffing around with fancy effects or a hired harp.The Smiths’Hatful of Hollow, which includes BBC sessions as well as a couple of early singles, is probably the most famous example of that approach, with many fans preferring the basic arrangements of songs like “What Difference Does It Make?” to those laid down for album release. But that thinking doesn’t really apply to Television Personalities, a band whose laissez faire attitude to the studio gave them a reputation as godfathers of lo-fi. If anything, the production on those four Peel session tracks—“Look Back in Anger,” “Picture of Dorian Gray” (sic), “Le Grande Illusion” (sic), and “Silly Girl”—is actually cleaner than on the band’s 1981 debut album,...And Don't the Kids Just Love It.\nMost notably, the Peel session guitars are more melodic and less distorted than on the band’s debut, in a way that points toward the group’s future influence on artists likeMGMTandPavement, rather than back at Television Personalities’ roots in punk. The intros to the Peel session versions of both “Silly Girl” and “Look Back in Anger” include brief but gorgeousByrds-ian guitar riffs that aren’t present in the rougher album takes, bringing to mind the delicate dramatics of earlyBelle and Sebastian."

Brothers Jack and George Barnett conduct themselves in a way that borders on recklessness, toiling at art music characterized by lofty ambitions, meticulous production values, and zero concession to any commercial concerns—one thing for those with deep pockets, quite another for a pair of working-class autodidacts from the Essex coast.\nBut such creative risks are paying off. These New Puritans’ discography forms a remarkable arc—every album different, often containing the seeds of the next. Following a detour into romantic Berlin art pop on 2019’sInside the Rose,Crooked Wing, their fifth studio album, revisits the terrain explored on 2013’s muted, neoclassicalField of Reeds. Again recorded with production assistance from Graham Sutton—once leader of British post-rockersBark Psychosis, now a sort of unofficial third New Puritan—Crooked Wingpresents carefully orchestrated chamber music as indebted to Benjamin Britten or Steve Reich as anything in the indie rock canon. The record is largely played on a suite of instruments—bells, piano, pipe organ, glockenspiel, and assorted brass—that have evolved little over decades, if not centuries. But These New Puritans are undeniably a modernist project, more concerned with forging their own aesthetic than indulging any nostalgic retread.\nOne of the secrets of the Barnetts’ success has been their skill at rallying others under their banner. OnCrooked Wing, the guest list includesCaroline Polachek, who duets with Jack on lead single “Industrial Love Song,” and the actor Alexander Skarsgård, who appears in the video to “A Season in Hell.” But celebrity confers no special privilege in These New Puritans’ universe, and such star turns rub shoulders with a wider cast that includes the likes of Canadian soprano Patricia Auchterlonie; Chris Laurence, a septuagenarian double bassist with a decades-long list of credits across British jazz and classical music; and Alex Miller, a 10-year-old member of Southend Boys Choir. Miller’s voice—at once fragile and powerful, naive and curiously ageless—is the first thing we hear onCrooked Wing, on the opening “Waiting,” and also the last, as that song’s lyrics are reprised on the closing “Return.” He is accompanied by an organ recorded at St Mary’s and All Saints Church in Stambridge, an instrument once played by the Barnetts’ grandfather—another suggestion of the way These New Puritans’ music seeks to collapse time, mingling the ancient and the contemporary."

    "review_text": "The theremin’s spooky, Soviet era-wail can conjure a panoply of vintage kitsch—lava lamps,The Twilight Zone, Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, awkward robots in black and white. From the groaning organ onTurnar’s opening track “Inni,”Hekladispatches such stereotypes like a medieval henchwoman, asserting the mid-century instrument’s modernity and range. Since 2018’sÁ, the Icelandic musician born Hekla Magnúsdóttir has put the instrument to thrillingly spectral ends, generating sounds as haunting as a tortured psyche. On her latest, Hekla plumbs the theremin’s weird, otherworldly depths, channeling a particularly contemporary bleakness that tethers it firmly to the 21st century.\nNamed for the rural French castle tower in which it was recorded,Turnarstraddles ancient and hypermodern sounds. Album standout “Kyrrð” foregrounds organ pipes that might have been teleported straight from the Middle Ages, played expertly by fellow Icelander Kristján Hrannar. The theremin enters like a ghostly howl. Later, “Ólga” shudders with heavy bass and the warbling vibrato of Hekla’s electronic signature. We’re wandering towards a locked door; we’re hoisting our candle into the dark passage. What’s more psychedelic than the feeling of primal fear, or persistent unease?\nTheremin has long been used to soundtrack the uncanny—from Hungarian composer Miklos Rózsa’s score for Hitchcock’sSpellboundto sci-fi films likeThe Day the Earth Stood Still—andTurnarcontinues in that tradition, building sweeping soundscapes that feel like odysseys. Album midpoint “Var” is a suitable climax for a horrifying discovery, throbbing bass layered under the theremin’s high keen and wordless vocals that sound like someone trapped inside a wall. It’s doomed and droning, a song to gird your loins or shatter your nerve.\nBut where other famous instances of the electromagnetic instrument have aged into camp, Hekla’s compositions feel more like the spiritual kin ofWendy Carlos’ score forThe Shining, which somehow both transcends and emblematizes its time. The ahistorical mix of sounds—distortion and cello, theremin and sub-bass—takes us out of time, and the sense of menace doesn’t pussyfoot around. These songs are as apt to send a peasant into cardiac arrest as they are to amplify the effects of an ill-advised edible, and in these unflinching tracks, Hekla centers her instrument as a compositional pillar. The Theremin isn’t an accessory. It doesn’t add flourishes or goofy trills onTurnar—it’s the unifying force that joins many disparate parts, placed as intentionally as chess pieces on a board.\nThe century-old instrument may be an unlikely source of novel sensations, but dread is timeless, and darkness comes for us all. Hekla’s greatest sleight of hand is triangulating the theremin with so many unexpected sounds, channeling centuries of horror into a postmodern milieu. Depending on where you stand, her playing sounds like the Sunday night before a Monday morning meeting or the ride from a village into a plague-ridden city. It’s roiling and uneasy; it’s as mysterious as the human condition.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "When I sawKelelalive in 2023, I remember finding something quite cat-like about her onstage performance. Her movements were frantic yet sharp, and in some instances, languid; she seemed always keenly aware of her body, even in a state of relaxation. This is how I imagined the D.C. native’s physical choreography while listening to her live album,In the Blue Light, recorded at New York’s hallowed Blue Note Jazz Club. Kelela’s 12-song set is a little over an hour long with tracks from across her discography, from the 2013 fan-fave mixtapeCut 4 Methrough to her most recent studio album,Raven. It’s a harp-assisted sojourn through the soundscapes that have made the singer-songwriter an inescapable part of electronic dance music’s very queer, future-facing gaze.\nIn Nikki Giovanni’s “Kidnap Poem,” the late author wrote “ever been kidnapped/by a poet/if i were a poet/i’d kidnap you/put you in my phrases and meter/you to jones beach/or maybe coney island.” This fervent longing to escape into, alongside, and perhaps away from love echoes in Kelela’s opener, “Enemy” a track that calls out and then forgives a disappointing partner, before she transitions into the sermon-like “Raven,” a solemn post-mortem of a relationship that only became lighter after it was released. Both of these works hold love’s sharpest points within their phrases, evoking the people we’ve taken to our favorite places during the lush days of a new romance, and the times long after, when that love became a lesson on renewal. These are hymns for people who prefer to self-soothe and tend to their hearts in solitude, evident on the gut punch that is “Take Me Apart.” Here, over a soft percussion, she is explicit in her expectations: “Don’t say you’re in love, baby/Don’t say you’re in love until you learn to take me apart,” preemptively blocking the emotional entanglements that occur when people find it easier tosaylove than to show up as someone who isinlove. It’s a terrifying demand but also one that clarifies. The track eases into the blushing and bashful “Bankhead,” which delicately ascends with an assist from a sparkling piano and a moving choral arrangement that includes the undeniably refined voice of up-and-coming Kenyan-Ugandan singer Xenia Manasseh.\nKelela has been in the game for over a decade, and holds the distinction of being prolific even though she’s released only a handful of projects. She is a masterful re-interpreter of her own songs, unafraid to redo and redo and redo, stripping away instrumentation, adding more stacked vocals, or bringing in the acoustics of a band. On 2015’sHallucinogen Remixes, released only a few months after herHallucinogenEP, “All the Way Down” is remixed twice, and each one is a reinvention of the artist’s chameleonic tastes. OnIn the Blue Light, “All the Way Down,” remixed again, is a standout gift. Lyrics like “Is my head in the way/’cause my heart can’t explain” reverberate at the beat of a pulse, projecting a single-minded and urgent need to see where the choice to stay in a relationship can lead. Not to be the person who always bringsJanet Jacksoninto any contemporary body of work that channels both the carnal and sensual parts of loving, but when the influence fits, it fits. Kelela’s poised seduction bears the imprints of “Anything” and “Are You Still Up” songs that transmit not only desire and longing, but patience for the right moment, the right hour."

    "review_text": "“I love having muses in my life,” 27-year-old pianist and singer Eliana Glass toldTone Glowin an April interview about the making ofE. “You’re inspired by them, and some element of them is embalmed in the music forever.” Her new album showcases the way simple choices in one person’s artistic practice can shimmer with the light of many past connections. Glass has a distinctive voice—mellow, sinewy, and down to earth, with an excitable undercurrent that demonstrates her enthusiasm for singing as a craft. She uses the methodical and malleable tools of vocal jazz to explore the ways other people’s lives reverberate throughout our own—via their songs, their words, or merely their presences.\nThe album’s reverence for the various relationships that inspired it is most evident in its constellation of musical reference points, both explicit and tangential. Glass performs works byCarla Bley,Karin Krog(“Sing Me Softly the Blues”), andAnnette Peacock(“Dreams”), and on “Song for Emahoy” channels thegentle, chromatic contemplationof the Ethiopian nun and pianistEmahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru. The haunting austerity of Glass’ arrangements on songs like “All My Life,” and her attention to the emotional contours of each syllable, sometimes position her as a Gen ZPatty Watersof sorts. Glass followed an unconventional path through her musical education, more interested in the rule-breaking freedom ofNina SimoneorElizabeth Fraserthan the typical playbook for a vocal jazz student. That curiosity is palpable acrossE, which avoids any singular mode to instead chase the fun of discovery, adaptation, and homage. Even a more straightforward number like “On the Way Down,” co-written with Eliana’s brother Costa, radiates a generous spirit, like it belongs in an intimate singalong rather than cooped up in a solo album. All kinds of people inhabit these songs.\nGlass foregrounds her process onE,making it feel circular, as if a full life is lived within the album’s tracklist; when she finds her way to the same words or chord progressions on multiple songs, it feels like stretching a muscle or relapsing into an old habit. The restraint of the instrumentation (mostly just piano, bass, and drums), despite the album’s formal range, means that any small shift in the spectral atmosphere can suggest something profound. An added layer of field recordings on the eerie \"Dreams\" recalls those Proustian early mornings when everything about the world seems momentarily novel, indelible, and strange. Glass is a nostalgist, in a sense, but the past she reaches for isn’t locked away. As you familiarize yourself with her tendencies as an improviser, you find yourself achingly waiting for her to resolve each phrase on her piano: feeling, thinking, and remembering alongside her, just as she does in turn alongside her own muses."

    "review_text": "IfDJ Pythonwants to tell us something important on his new EP, then he seems a little shy about spitting it out. The record’s title is a declaration—or the start of one?—hedged in lowercase letters, offered without further explanation. Buried among the EP’s invited guests, the producer sings for the first time on a solo Python record, like a reluctant child being pushed into the spotlight.\nAn obvious comparison for this new frontier in Brian Piñeyro’s career isJames Blake’s debut album, where the UK producer first revealed his politely impassioned voice to listeners who had grown up on his gnarled post-dubstep productions. Python’s patented mixture of deep house, left-field electronics, and reggaeton beats has different roots, but the two artists share a certain spirit of stylistic invention and melodic intelligence—notmainstream, exactly, but in conversation with it.i was put on this earthisn’t quite Python’s vocal coming-out—he lent his voice to “III” on his 2023Natural Wonder Beauty Conceptalbum withAna Roxanne—but it is his first release on indie powerhouse XL, potentially bringing his music to a wider audience.\nMaybe that makes Python’s vocal turn sound like a commercial calculation. But it shouldn’t.i was put on this earthis a bold move couched in some of Piñeyro’s most pointedly low-key production, his floaty, swinging funk nudged several steps further into the infinite. “Marry Me Maia,” the EP’s opening song, has only the suggestion of rhythm, carried along by slivers of crystalline synth and a bassy pulse. “Coquine” sets Piñeyro’s vocal on a bed of eerie instrumental wash and electronic prickle; and “Elio’s Lived Behind My House Forever” (with New York’sPhysical Therapy) marries a sluggish electro beat to keyboard melodies that warp and wash like vintageMy Bloody Valentine. It is fitting, then, that Piñeyro’s vocals on “Marry Me Maia” and “Coquine” sound a lot likeKevin Shields’: hazy, understated to the point of stupor, but capable of carrying a serious emotional load.\nThese aren’t the kind of vocal qualities we expect from an artist who ostensibly operates in the world of dance music. There’s no dembow oni was put on this earth, despite the appearance of reggaeton whirlwindIsabella Lovestoryon the sprightly “Besos Robados,” and no deep house either. A closer point of reference might be Python’s recentBBC Radio One Essential Mix, in which he spun the spectral electronics of Chloé’s “The Waiting Room” alongsideBlonde Redhead,Philip Glass, andHildur Guðnadóttir&Jóhann Jóhannsson.

    "review_text": "Ever since Black evacuees of Hurricane Katrina carried New Orleans bounce to major cities of the South, traces of the dance-rap genre have infused popular music. But nothing gets the party crackin’ like the jittery soul of the real thing. After Katrina,OnlyHeaven’s family was split between New Orleans and Atlanta, but she stayed in her hometown with her dad, soaking up the energetic call-and-response chants ofKatey Redand the rawness ofMagnolia Shorty. Her pops was close with her older cousin Hot Boy Ronald, who dropped the local hit “Walk Like Ronald”—which sounds like the “Cha Cha Slide” if it got the Mannie Fresh touch—in the early 2000s. “Walk Like Ronald” integrated the “Triggerman” beat, a nickname for the flickering instrumental of ’80s Queens hip-hop group the Showboys’ “Drag Rap,” which is sometimes argued to have kicked off bounce when MC T. Tucker and DJ Irv chopped it up on 1991’s “Where Dey At.” That same signature sample opens up Heaven’s EPKISS (Keep It Short & Sweet), five screwball romantic comedy bounce joints made for the loudest sound systems.\nLast year, the outrageously catchy “2 Shots” shotputted Heaven onto my radar. I was stuck on how it merged the dancefloor MCing ofbouncepioneerswith the raunchy storytelling favored by thecurrentgeneration, and also the wicked flip ofMichael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror” vocals. A copyright strike forced her to remove that sample, a buzzkill because part of the spirit of bounce is in the way producers choose to let samples breathe or dice them up, endlessly reinterpreting older songs. Heaven and her producers don’t let that get them down onKISS, threading in samples across genres and using her imperfect, rasping bulldozer of a voice to sauce up throwback melodies. On “Never Hard,” big-time bounce producer Slash rolls an immediately familiar pop-punk guitar into scratches and twitchy drums, and Heaven is hollering a twist on a pop hook of the recent past: “Me and my hoes take niggas together, through the storm/No matter the weather, cold or warm.” It’s wild, though disconnected from the romanticism of the four other songs onKISS.\nIn a genre that revolves around singles, remixes, and DJ sets,KISSis loosely strung together by stories of falling in love so hard that the emotional whirlwind rivals aBachelorcontestant being picked on by the show producers. Throughout the tape, as the beats freak the hell out, Heaven drops in hilariously ridiculous ground rules for her man. On “No Friends,” he must drop all of his female childhood pals and disappear from the internet so no other girl can lay their plotting eyes on him. On “No Heart,” he must be willing to be taken to the afterlife in her name. All the scenes of love, horniness, or frustration start with her man either obeying her conditions or trying to weasel his way out of monogamy."

    "review_text": "Here’s the beginning of an unfunny joke: “Thurston Moorewalks into anIn Uterosession.” Here’s the beginning of another unfunny joke: “Umpteenth indie rock band tries to sound like Thurston Moore walked into anIn Uterosession.” Influences become jokes when they’re hollow, “worn on sleeves” like designer on a mannequin. (Bettergetinline.) In the right hands, homage is a launchpad—less about the past than the weird, oddly familiar thing it’s growing into. Few understand this better thanVoyeur, a New York band that runs the city’s history through a funhouse mirror and emerges with a twisty, well-studied take on decades’ worth of alt-rock squall.Something Becomes You, their latest EP, isNo WavemeetsNirvanameets the sweaty solipsism of lonely subway rides. It isn’t a joke; it’s the work of a band worth taking seriously.\nIn an underground New York context, Voyeur nearly qualify as a supergroup—you might recognize singer-guitarist Jake Lazovick asSitcom, former bassist Joe Kerwin (since replaced by Isaac Eiger) as the brain behind the newsletterYou Missed It, or singer-guitarist Sharleen Chidiac as a founder of the performance spacePageant. Their approach to post-punk is both starry-eyed and squalid, like the strange affection a lifelong city-dweller might feel for derelict buildings. Similar dichotomies—ugly and lush, filthy and romantic, serious and slightly self-deprecating—comprise the scaffolding of their formula. But what makes them such a jolt is how adeptly they dart between extremes.Ugly, the debut EP they released last February, so proficiently channeled alt-rock’s past that at times it seemed like areallygood parody. Take “Big Decision,” in which a foamy-mouthed Lazovick plays frenzied incel over afee-fi-fo-fumrhythm section. It sounds like Kurt Cobain stumbled into the wrong rehearsal space, saidwhat the hell, and started jamming with Steve Shelley. It also sounds unbelievably solid—like a band that’s played together for 20 years, not one.\nThis holds true throughoutSomething Becomes You, a follow-up that keeps alt-rock influences at the forefront, but reroutes them in riskier ways. It’s more insular than the lovestruckUgly, a wintry antidote to that project’sroaringromantics. The frigid glare of this new EP befits a New York lineage of off-kilter bands who extracted epics from emotional distance. It’s one thing for a two-guitar lineup to weaponize both six-strings as a wall of scuzz, but another—slightly more difficult—thing to make both guitars interlock uneasily, a tightrope of arpeggios and sickly sustain. The interplay makes even the most straightforward songs, like “Spirit,” feel imbued with something sinister: a creeping feeling that at any moment, this could all fall apart. Sometimes it does and the deconstructions are gut-churning and sublime, like watching a controlled demolition. By the final minute of “Look Through You,” a slow-burn guitar showcase that devolves toward “The Diamond Sea” territory, the only survivor is screeching feedback, wailing like an eternal police siren."

    "review_text": "Halfway throughDavid Grubbs’ epic poemThe Voice in the Headphones, a micromanaging director Skypes in for a “pep talk,” interrupting the book’s film-scoring protagonist in the middle of a studio session. “I’m going to start calling you the Squanderer so that everyone thinks you have an immense talent,” the director tells the composer. “You’ll thank me for this. If you’re stuck in the Studio Bs of the world it’s not because at one time you weren’t regarded as a serious talent, but because you squandered it.”\nThe moniker is an odd fit for the renowned, prolific players in Grubbs’ new trio with fellow guitarist-composerWendy Eisenbergand bassist, producer, and Shimmy-Disc label headKramer. But their debut album,If a Body Meet a Body, sprouted from a spontaneous squandering session one afternoon in a Studio B somewhere in New York. Recording live, they explored for exploration’s sake, with no stated goal or preconceived theme beyond observing instantaneous collisions of sound and space. And in these “squandered” hours, they tunneled into a collective essence greater than the sum of their considerable parts.\nEach ofIf a Body Meet a Body’s seven “themes” is named for a particular phenomenon, demographic, or setting—airplane vapor trails, soft-spoken cowpokes, at-home viewers, quiet cars. The album starts and ends with the fellow-travelers’ ballad “Theme for Squanderers” and its reprise, both of which operate on uneven ground. Kramer opens these tracks with a low bass note and a higher, watery drone that alternate irregularly as the song’s tonal centers, often disappearing entirely, leaving Grubbs and Eisenberg to fill the negative space in their wakes. In some instances, the two guitarists remain in this suspended state; in others, they touch down with a satisfying two-chord riff that releases the tension for a moment.\nThis group dynamic prevails throughout, even when the musical dynamics change. On the noisy “Theme for Contrails,” Eisenberg is given room to air out their technical chops. But even in their shreddiest moments, they seem to be listening deeply to Grubbs’ and Kramer’s’ parts. On the much quieter “Theme for Silent Cowboys,” Eisenberg’s technical precision plays off of the wide-open spaces Grubbs loves to create, but it never feels like anyone’s taking a solo.\n“Theme for Viewers at Home” is the vital connective tissue between the album’s two distinct halves, crackling at the start with electric fuzz that dampens into distant cable static as the song moves on. Then, cued by a muffled call of “Are we rolling?” at the start of “Theme for Pattern Recognition,” the Squanderers abandon the familiar terrain of locked-in, free-improv jazz. Like the tape-obsessed lead character ofThe Voice in the Headphones, they’re in peak squandering mode, discarding side A’s tight, comfy feel in favor of eerier airspace. Everything is deconstructed now, and the patterns grow more and more difficult to recognize. “Theme for Quiet Car” is all atonal melodies and extended technique, culminating in a dissonance as taut as an uptuned high E string and as thin as a palm-muted pluck. Even here, though, there’s very little actual silence—striking, considering Squanderers’ patient approach to collaboration. When one guitar fades out, the other slips in. When both disappear, Kramer is close behind with something low and slow."

She’s performed as a back-up vocalist and guitarist forJennifer Castle,Kiwi Jr., andU.S. Girls, the last of whom has also credited her as a vocal arranger. It’s an enviable network; Paas has called on U.S. Girls leader Meg Remy for“insight about industry stuff”and tapped Slim Twig, the eccentric mastermind ofBadge Époque Ensemble, when she needed studio time or mixing services.\nIn 2021, Paas finally released a solo album of her own,Anything Can’t Happen, after nearly a decade in the indie trenches. A quietly enveloping break-up album driven by Paas’s fluttering, birdlike voice, it drew acclaim, got longlisted for the Polaris prize, and revealed the longtime back-up performer as an arresting singer-songwriter in her own right.Think Of Mist, Paas’s second, is even better: a swooning song cycle perched between folk-pop and choral jazz. With its chintzy synths and New Age warmth, it clearly emerges from the same regional scene that produced records like Bernice’sCruisin’andFresh Pepper’sself-titled, albums enamored with a kind of smooth-jazz kitsch.\nYet Paas’s wide-eyed sincerity, and her preoccupation with pleasures of the natural world, override any sense of artifice. She has described “Maybe I’ll Fade,” the album’s dreamy, hymn-like centerpiece, as “a psychosexual ode to Niagara Falls,” and she does not seem to be joking. The song swells with childlike wonder, its melody percolating instead of repeating, as the singer yearns to be “the water in the waterfall/Both endless, and endlessly new.” Eventually, it evaporates into “Made of Mist” (get it?), a wordless coda of gushing water and ethereal harmonies. With respect toTLC, no music has ever been hornier for a waterfall.\nPaas’s clear, crystallic voice, refined during a childhood stint in an opera choir, gives the album an otherworldly glow. On meandering folk tunes like “Autumn Roses” and “No Metaphor,” her voice has a freewheeling quality that evokesCourt and Spark-eraJoni Mitchell—the way it floats above the chords, sliding in and out of harmony, hewing to its own peculiar melodic logic. On “Whatever That Means,” she takes a song about uncertainty and spins that emotion on its head by layering her voice into a technicolor patchwork of harmonies. Lyrics that seem ambivalent on the page (“It’s normal to not be in love/Or if you are in love/It is normal to not really be sure”) are bathed in a woozy sonic profundity. Even the record’s least engaging song, “Night Picture,” is enriched by Paas’s facility with eccentric voice arrangements, which bring some color to an otherwise listless ballad."

    "review_text": "At the outset ofTune-Yards’ vibrant new albumBetter Dreaming, Merrill Garbus asks in a hushed voice, “Ready?” It’s the sound of a performer steeling herself, a private inhale before unleashing “Heartbreak,” a full-bodied groove full of joy and pain in equal measure. “Watch me survive another heartbreak,” Garbus intones sweetly, before belting her way through a rousing chorus and a middle eight of sheer vocal force. It’s an apt introduction to a record that charts the tense relationship between vulnerability and strength.\nBetter Dreamingis the sixth studio album from Garbus, who first debuted as a solo artist with the lo-fi tapeBiRd-BrAiNsand now collaborates as a duo with her partner, multi-instrumentalist and producer Nate Brenner. Armed with a ukulele, head-spinning percussion, and a liberally used loop pedal, Garbus built a reputation for visceral, biting alternative pop music built on the rhythms of Afro-pop and funk. Tune-Yards’ most recent records, 2018’sI Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Lifeand 2021’ssketchy., both reckoned directly with Garbus’s position as a white woman working in African musical traditions, and with whiteness more generally. Though ambitious, the songs lacked some of the hurricane dynamism of the earlier music, feeling instead restrained and careful, and sometimes weighed down by fear and guilt. On the breezierBetter Dreaming, Garbus continues to examine our political landscape—and her own position in it—with her usual unflinching lyrical style, but this time it’s been metabolized into something more outward-facing and hopeful: songs you can really dance to.\nGarbus has previouslyspokenabout the importance of singing, vocalizing, and humming as “a pathway through the hardest parts of our psyches.”Better Dreamingfeels like her fullest expression of that idea; her voice sounds more full-bodied than ever as she urges you to “sing yourself into existence” at the cacophonous finale of album closer “Sanctuary.” Tune-Yards’ instrumentation has famously been dense with ideas, loops, and samples, but here it’s more often pulled taut, to allow Garbus’s voice to rush like water to fill every crack. On the title track, her languishing cries are layered together in a digital ocean that washes over the listener. Later, on “See You There,” what begins as a plaintive folk song erupts into a scream that crackles with distortion and rage.\nIt’s Tune-Yards’ most accessible and melodic album to date. “Limelight,” the funk-driven lead single, wasinspiredby Garbus and Brenner dancing toGeorge Clintonwith their toddler—who also features on backing vocals—and it’s no surprise to learn that it was conceived with family-friendly dance parties in mind. The music may lack some of the experimental bite that characterized early Tune-Yards releases likew h o k i l l, but it’s still colored by Garbus’s political intent: “Let go of the life you’re living,”the sun-bright chorus urges: “Let yourself see how free you can be.”"

One of the first Dallas rappers to get a buzz was the D.O.C., who broke out in the late ’80s with the homegrown Fila Fresh Crew, then hit the road to L.A., assisting withN.W.A.and the rise of Death Row. In the mid-aughts through the early 2010s, the Dallas boogie scene popped—a grassroots movement of slow-mo club-rap jams (Lil Wil’s “My Dougie,” Treal Lee and Prince Rick’s “Mr. Hit That,” The Party Boyz’s “Flex”) with infinite loose-limbed dances to match. It launched a few countrywide grade-school dance classics, but immortal hip-wobbling moves like the Dougie andRicky Bobbybecame ingrained inpop culturethrough theirCaliforniaoffshoots.\nCompared to Houston, Dallas lacked the musical infrastructure, reach, and industry co-signs. But by the mid-2010s, this seemed to be changing, when Mo3 went on a run of raw, melodic ballads that mergedBoosie-ish blues with the scenic, leisurely Dallas reality rap of the 2000s (Big Tuck,Big Chief, etc.)—perfect to be blasted out of a whip with a fresh coat of candy paint. But in 2020, fresh off “Broken Love,” a multi-platinum collab withKevin Gates, he was murdered on a freeway in Dallas. His posthumous albumShottaz 4 Evahit the charts, but the moment felt cut short.\nRecently, a wave of Dallas street rappers have emerged on a mission to finally take the city’s music mainstream. Unified under the hashtag #NewDallas, they’re combining bits of regional scenes of the past and present into a flood of rags-to-riches stories a lot like the ones up and down HeadHuncho Amir’sSTILL AIN NUN BIGGER. The smooth-talker’s tape is the latest in a string of noisemaking full-lengths of the city—joining Zillionaire Doe’sD Boi Dreams, released in January, and Montana 700’s700 Reasons, in February—where the backstory on how the scene reached this point is more interesting than the music itself.\nComing on the heels of October’sAIN NUN BIGGER,STILL AIN NUN BIGGER(hopefully he goes theRichHomieQuanroutewith the mixtape titles) is easy-to-listen-to, no-frills motivation rap. You can visualize it inoffensively playing at a club with a bottle service or soundtracking college football training montages—the music video for the tape’s generic hometown anthem “Motivate the City” leans into that by actually including footage from an SMU football practice. EvokingRick Ross’ underdeveloped brand of boss rap, which he made before cranking up the theater onDeeper Than Rap, Amir is heavy on unimaginative tales of steak dinners, Zoom meetings, and getting chauffeured around in black SUVs; obligatory dreams of riding in private jets and making one billion dollars; and life coach tips: “My advice to these young niggas learn how to save,” he raps on “Blow.” The point is to present himself as a Dallas boy who beat the odds and turned himself into a young rap mogul, which can make for exciting rap—but only if the details pop."

He’s a savvy pop synthesist who stands as one of his generation’s most reliable purveyors ofvibed-outindiestreamcore, but he’s also a restless musical nomad drawn to free-flowing exploration that steers clear of the algorithm. Initially, the latter facet surfaced primarily through UMO’s live performances, where modest three-minute tunes are liable to get stretchedinto shred-tastic seven-minute psychedelic odysseys. But it’s best captured by UMO’sIC(Improvisation/Collaboration) album series, launched in 2018 as a means to venture deeper into foreign territory—both figuratively and literally—by capturing extended instrumental jam sessions in far-flung cities with local musicians in tow.\nIf the inauguralICentry,Hanoi, largely centred Ruban’s Hendrixian guitar pyrotechnics, the second installment feels like a more holistic, 360-degree representation of the band’s capabilities. Recorded in the namesake Colombian city,Bogotásees Ruban flanked by a familiar cast of long-time UMO associates—drummer/brother Kody, saxophonist/father Chris, and bassist/guitarist Jacob Portrait—as they welcome recently recruited keyboardist Christian Li and guest percussionist Jose David Infante into the fold. Ruban’s singing voice is once again absent from theseICproceedings, but so too is his preferred mode of nonverbal communication: The record contains not a single spotlight-seizing guitar solo, putting the focus instead on Li and the elder Nielson's virtuosity. And whereHanoidrifted toward jazzy abstraction,Bogotásees the band run wild over a much sturdier foundation of gritty grooves and DIY basement-club beats.\nEven though Unknown Mortal Orchestra outgrew its home-recording roots long ago to become the sort of globetrotting entity liable to recorda single album across four continents, their work has largely retained a hermetic quality. ButBogotátaps into the energy that teems on the streets outside the studio walls, vividly and viscerally channelling the nervous excitement of wandering through a new city at night as the bars start to fill up with Friday-evening revellers, drinks of dubious nature get passed around, and the streetlights start to blur into luminous streaks. Eleven-minute opener “Earth 1” wastes no time thrusting you into the melee, with a relentless percussive pulse and a circular flute refrain like a traffic whistle, clearing a path for Li to work his magic on electric piano. But after four solid minutes of cosmic keyboard wanderlust, Li introduces a repeating riff that locks into the main groove with puzzle-piece precision, transmuting the track’s frenetic bustle into zen-state bliss."

    "review_text": "James Holdendiscovered trance states as a child, hammering out repetitive chords for hours on the piano. ForWacław Zimpel, Polish folk music and American blues offered early glimpses of higher states of consciousness. Since those introductory ear- and mind-openers, the search for musical transcendence has guided both artists in their respective journeys. Holden began his career as a teenager playing capital-T trance music—gated chord stabs, energy-stoking snare rolls, backmasked cymbals, the whole kit and caboodle—before drifting into increasingly woolier strains of ambient techno and electronic improv, includinglatter-day krautrock,homagestoTerry Riley, andpan-global folk musicthat calls to mind benevolent UFOs hovering above Stonehenge. Zimpel, a clarinetist by training, has moved through free jazz, Indian Carnatic music, and even a 2020collaborationwithShackleton, the dubstep convert turned arpeggiator shaman. What the two men’s work shares is an attentiveness to the minutiae of change, and a propensity for sequences that churn like thunderheads on the prowl.\nHolden and Zimpel first linked up in 2018, recording together in the British musician’s London studio on a handful of dates—connected by a string of gigs featuring the clarinetist as a member of Holden’s touring ensemble, the Animal Spirits. The collaboration yielded the appropriately namedLong WeekendEP, four tracks of rippling pulses and drones built up in live overdubs of reeds and modular synthesizer, one song per day. They return now withThe Universe Will Take Care of You, a six-track, 51-minute album that feels bigger and more consequential in every way, folding more ideas, intensities, moods, and dimensions into its freeform sprawl.\nEach of the six tracks is tagged with the date of its creation, a neat bit of marginalia that gives us some idea of how the sessions unrolled. The album begins on July 19, 2022, their third consecutive day of recording, at which point they were well and truly cooking. After a brief, breath-catching introduction that faintly recalls the vocoded lead-in toLaurie Anderson’s “O Superman”—and given the title, “You Are Gods,” the reference may not be entirely coincidental—they explode into action, unleashing volley after volley of rapid-fire arpeggios that move far too fast for mere mortals to parse. (Thirty-second notes? Sixth-fourth notes? Your guess is as good as mine.) Burbling and twisting, branching and recombining, they change color as they go, arpeggios erupting out of arpeggios, like jets of water in an illuminated fountain. Holden is credited with “arpeggio clouds,” Zimpel with alto clarinet, organ, and “grains,” but which sounds belong to whom is anyone’s guess—the thrill of the thing is in its overwhelming totality. Occasionally, an accidental melody asserts itself in a sequence of notes that somehow, by some miracle of filtering and timbre, breaks through the blur, but it’d be impossible to track every voice, much less every note; it’s enough to let it all wash over you, a jacuzzi for the mind."

    "review_text": "Brooklyn-based DJ and musicianKilbourne’s new album,If Not to Give a Fantasy, growls with ecstatic violence. Frenetic as it feels, her industrial hardcore follows a simple method: louder, faster, harder. That could be a setup for monotony, but Kilbourne weaves in marimba, bird calls, and industrial trills to build an electronic orchestra. Despite the constraints of the genre—gravity-force four-on-the-floor, bare drones—her take on the sound is never boring. “I think it’s a way of reflecting and redirecting experiences that feel brutal or relentless,” she said in a2018 interview. Get in or get out.\nKilbourne started out making club music, though she’s since sworn off the genre, focusing instead on industrial hardcore with a minimal edge. Though she came up in the queer and trans nightlife scene, she sees herself as “conservative,” playing into traditional ideas about what defines hardcore music. The dizzying ferocity of the lead single, “Double BBL”—not to mention stated influences likeBurialandA.G. Cook—makes that label sound like a misnomer. While not as alienating as 2022’sCathedralsEP, “Double BBL” demonstrates that Kilbourne can still eviscerate the dancefloor with pummeling, operatic degeneracy.\nIf Not to Give a Fantasyis a distillation of what makes hardcore so seductive: the opportunity to be annihilated, to enter a new hallucinatory realm. Kilbourne first garnered underground press for 2018’sBloodrave: Music From Blade, a musical re-imagining of the film’s jaw-dropping opening vampiric bloodbath. These days she’s a regular at Boiler Room and queer Brooklyn parties like Unter; she also hosts her own hardcore night, Hammerhead, which doubles as the name of her independent label. At any given Kilbourne set, you’re likely to see a throng of trans women robed in black.Hunter Schafer isa fan—even claiming she wanted to take DJ lessons.\n“Hardcore is for freaks,” Kilbourne hassaid. Some DJs like to play full songs or intersperse iconic house tracks; Kilbourne goes on the offense, demanding attention with her brutal BPMs and aggro bravado. Her eviscerating guitar licks ramp up slowly before incinerating and mutating into sludgey walls of reverb. She often makes use of icy, sarcastic vocal snippets: “I hate bald boys. I can’t stand bald boys,” the eponymous “Bald Boys” ironically exalts,samplingI Think You Should Leaveover a stuttering backdrop. On “Loon Call,” she samples the Minnesota state bird, creating a disorientingly powerful contrast to the gabbering beat.\nOnIf Not to Give a Fantasy, speed begets speed as Kilbourne experiments with new riffs on her minimalistic formula. It’s just enough to flirt with her more palatable contemporaries without giving into the urge to go full-on club. The penultimate track, “Deer Stomps Its Hooves in Warning,” features warm synths and a marimba-influenced melody long before the beat kicks in, eventually weaving deep kick drums alongside the pulsing, glittery notes. By the four-minute mark, we’re ready for heavier drums that glitch and crunch with propulsive power. Across the clawing antics of “Honeycrisp” and the subterranean sirens of “Loon Call,” Kilbourne manages to indulge her impulses without sacrificing reckless ecstasy. Both wilder than her previous records and yet somehow more polished,If Not to Give a Fantasyoffers a welcoming portal into the feral magnetism of the alternative hardcore scene."

    "review_text": "Though she has spent nearly four decades as an icon of nonchalant alt-rock cool,Kim Dealis no stranger to the big gesture. The indie-rock standard she penned as bassist ofPixiesis called “Gigantic,” after all. When she struck out on her own withthe Breeders, her hit, “Cannonball,” was about diving into hell and making the hugest possible splash. But Deal has never taken such unexpected swings as she does onNobody Loves You More, her first proper solo album since becoming a fixture in the story of indie in 1986. Ninety seconds into the opening track, a full-blown brass section bursts in, announcing a different side of Deal, and unlocking the baroque-pop grandeur hidden in the heart of a slack-rock god.\nDeal’s voice is a sly smile, sweet and tough, like candy and cigarettes. Holding rock’s loud-quiet surges at the impressionistic simmer of a punk Rothko, she remains an avatar for the power in being oneself, which often requires acceptance of the unknown, the possibility of the hard fall. She has accordingly spentrecentinterviewsstating that her favorite part of art is failure. “Maybe not the failure itself,” Deal clarified, “but the stories that come from it.” She saidelsewhere: “There’s something really sweet and endearing about somebody who got their ass kicked. They were out there trying.” The blistering blood harmonies of the Breeders—which Deal still helms with her twin sister Kelley—have by now traveled from the biker bars of Dayton, Ohio, to the arenas of both theIn UteroandGutstours. The chronicles of Deal’s “please-no-chops” entry into Pixies, gigging in her 1980s secretary clothes, are indie-rock folk tales. But risk has always been the subtext.\nAt times the lavish precision ofNobody Loves You Moreimagines Deal on an island masterminding her own meticulousPet Sounds. Though she’s been Breeders’ primary songwriter for over three decades—and has likened her 1995 side-project the Amps, a lo-fi rock band, to a solo record—Nobody Loves You Moreis the first time she’s followed every sonic impulse and fully owned them, even as she’s joined by 20 other musicians. Deal strums a ukulele on the majestic orchestral ballad “Summerland.” She delivers a loose rap on the industrial “Big Ben Beat” and produces scorched dance-punk on “Crystal Breath.” Her adventurousness is grounded by candor. She wrote these eclectic songs between 2011 and 2022, years she spent home in Dayton caring for her ailing parents, who both passed shortly before the pandemic, and the album’s bittersweet tenor mixes grief, beauty, regret, and release, sometimes all at once. She repeatedly sings of wanting to duck out of her life to start over, longing for real change. “Show me what’s not possible/And I’ll come running,” Deal sings on the expressive “Come Running,” where she plays every unhurried instrument."

    "review_text": "Twenty years ago last month,Burialreleased his debut EP—and unleashed a ghost. The British producer’s music, shot through with a sense of loss and veiled in vinyl crackle, epitomized a blurry set of ideas about nostalgia and otherworldliness that were bubbling up across a swath of experimental music. Soon, shepherded by critics Mark Fisher and Simon Reynolds, a new term had entered the lexicon: “hauntology.” Borrowed from French postmodernist philosopher Jacques Derrida’s 1993 bookSpecters of Marx, hauntology, in Fisher’s framing, hovers miasmically over a loose nexus of ideas around melancholy, technology, memory, and capitalism. Examining the work of a number of like-minded artists, including Burial,Philip Jeck,the Caretaker, and the figures behind theGhost Boxlabel, he later wrote: “Their work sounded ‘ghostly,’ certainly, but the spectrality was not a mere question of atmospherics. What defined this ‘hauntological’ confluence more than anything else was its confrontation with a cultural impasse: the failure of the future.”\nAs a description of ghostly affect and 21st-century disappointment, hauntology has been a largely British phenomenon—and, despite Fisher’s philosophical intent, has often been invoked mainly to mean, “sounds spooky.” But for those who know where to look, Latin American electronic music has long buzzed with hauntological portent, and with good reason: With its overlapping histories of genocide, colonialism, dictatorship, migration, organized crime, thwarted utopia, and rapacious neoliberalism, Latin America knows a thing or two about failed futures. Numinous energy ripples through the wraithlike voices ofLucrecia Dalt’sAnticlines,No era sólida, and¡Ay!; it chills the blood inDebit’sThe Long Count, which used synthesis and machine learning to resuscitate the sounds of the ancient Maya; it rises like narcotic vapors from the plodding tempos ofcumbia rebajada, born when a malfunctioning soundsystem began playing back the upbeat tropical style at a funereal pace and gravelly pitch. (“When you slow down the cumbia,” Nicolás Vallejo, whose work asEzmeraldafilters cumbia rebajada into an ambient haze, onceexplained, “the ghosts start to emerge.”)\nFantología I, released by the Quito, Ecuador, label+ambién, is framed as a Latin American response to the discourse around hauntology—a discourse that label heads Gregorio Hernández (DJ +1) and Daniel Lofredo (Quixosis) say has too often turned a blind eye to the Global South. The object of their scrutiny is “a very Latin American kind of uncertainty,” they write: “an ever-present ghost that shadows the region in the 21st century.” Where the Global North mourns “lost golden ages”—the sci-fi futurism of the 1960s, the renegade paradise of ’80s rave—they instead “confront the specter of failed statehood, chronic instability, and the fading promise of futures that may never arrive. These tracks reflect on a society forever negotiating a compromised tomorrow—and discovering how to live, even love, within that tension.”"

    "review_text": "Critters scamper throughA Ghost Is Born, the extraordinary finale ofJeff TweedyandWilco’s most experimental era. Birds, bees, bugs, dogs, and spiders poke their heads out of lyrics steeped in celestial abstraction, cry out over seiches of art rock, and retreat to the shadows. Years later, inhis memoir, Tweedy would explain how the animals arrived during the album’s writing phase, a time when he was getting walloped by multiple chronic disorders, subsequent opioid addiction, and mistreatment at the hands of negligent medical professionals—the combination of which would soon culminate in weeks of in-patient rehab. “I was pretty sure I was going to die,” he wrote. “It felt like a big flood was coming, something no one could survive. So I was saving anything I could, piling it all onto this ark.” These animals—each representing a different aspect of his personality, so that his family might be able to posthumously piece him together—served a higher purpose: Jeff Tweedy was writing his own epitaph, his swan song.\nHe would survive the deluge, but the idea—Wilco’s Noah’s Ark concept album—would not: He ditched that blueprint midway through. And ultimately,A Ghost Is Bornis more dynamic and ambitious than a biblical flood metaphor rock album probably could have been. Wilco’s fifth LP is at various points head-splittingly noisy, hypnotically hushed, a bloodletting, a blast, and it all amounts to a wider exploration of what it means to care amid a surrounding world’s collapse. Twenty-plus years after its initial release—and commemorated here with a gargantuan 13-piece box set that exhaustively pieces together its rocky origins—it has never sounded so enduring.\nBy 2003, Wilco were reaching levels so high that their chemistry and capabilities as a full band simply needed to shine above all. Early that year, Tweedy made an adventurous debut album withLoose Fur, his avant-garde side project with drummer and percussionistGlenn Kotcheand composer and studio utility knifeJim O’Rourke, whose auspicious introduction three years earlier made sparks fly and later reinjected Wilco with newfound creative abandon (and politicking) after Tweedy brought them into the fold. O’Rourke’s inside-out touch behind the boards would become the new standard after his mixing offered the final, code-cracking breakthrough toYankee Hotel Foxtrot, a eulogic dissection of man and nation through a kaleidoscopic Americana lens that happened to coincide with the September 11 attacks and was soon followed by the invasion of Iraq.\nO’Rourke played a major role inA Ghost Is Bornfrom start to finish, this time as co-producer and occasional supporting player. By now intimately familiar with the respective personalities of the senior band members, including bassist John Stirratt and multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach, he brings out their best, especially on “Muzzle of Bees.” O’Rourke wrote the delicately fingerpicked opening, which the band gradually assembles into a sophisticated apex while Tweedy seems to exhale words of naturalistic impressionism. By the time it reaches its stunning instrumental coda, its fine contours are swarming with overdriven amp fuzz. O’Rourke—in that era a full-time member ofSonic Youthwho had already had a hand in over 200 albums, includingsomeindie classics—was floored by the final mix. He realized just how badly Tweedy was struggling when he watched him react to the same mix with indifference."

    "review_text": "Over the past 30 years,Mogwaihave gifted us some of the greatest song titles in the history of music-naming rights. Where their post-rock peers lean towardearnest sentimentoralarmist messaging, Mogwai treat their tracklists like bathroom-stall graffiti. Whether it’s “I’m Jim Morrison, I’m Dead,” “Don’t Believe the Fife,” or “Stupid Prick Gets Chased by the Police and Loses His Slut Girlfriend,” their titles are less about communicating the specific mood or implicit intent of a song than providing an outlet for absurdist inside jokes. But on their 11th album, Mogwai come up with a song title that’s so on-brand, they should put it on bumper stickers and ball caps.\nAppearing two tracks intoThe Bad Fire, “Hi Chaos” reads like Mogwai’s version of “hello Newman”: a habitual greeting to an old adversary encountered time and time again. But as the song demonstrates, the earth-quaking eruptions that previously defined the band have become less an endgame than a routine passing phenomenon. In lieu of the creeping build-ups and climactic crescendos of past Mogwai set pieces, “Hi Chaos” ambles about as if on a leisurely Sunday-afternoon stroll, and once the song’s bluesy refrain gives way to a needling downpour of guitar noise, Mogwai effectively pop open an umbrella, ensuring safe passage through the storm. While it may lack the element of surprise that powered their most totemic works, “Hi Chaos” is emblematic of Mogwai’s m.o. today: Where they once reveled in disrupting ominous quietude with explosive outbursts, these days, they’d rather redirect tense energy into uplifting expression. As such, a band that once offered apocalyptic mayhem has become a source of comforting consistency as the real world turns evermore turbulent.\nFor the past decade or so, Mogwai have been enjoying a new lease on life similar to the ’80s reinventions of  prog-rock figureheads like Rush, Yes, and Genesis: Synths have become as integral to their sound as guitars; the songs no longer stretch past the 15-minute mark; and the band’s exploratory sensibilities are counterbalanced by a melodic finesse. In the process, Mogwai have also managed to gain new fans without alienating too many old ones: With 2021’sAs the Love Continues, they became the rare veteran indie-rock band to score a U.K. No. 1 album a quarter-century into their existence.\nBut the band’s current cruising altitude has not been without shocks of turbulence. WhileThe Bad Fire’s title might feelparticularly relevantright now, it actually derives from an old Scottish slang term for “hell.” And that’s an apt description of multi-instrumentalist Barry Burns’ experience as recording commenced: His young daughter had just received a bone marrow transplant and chemo treatment, and her prospects of survival were uncertain. Thankfully, she pulled through, and while the album’s opening track, “God Gets You Back,” is not explicitly about that ordeal, it nonetheless stands as a testament to her perseverance. Following a tense two-minute opening flurry of arpeggiated synths, the song achieves liftoff thanks to Martin Bulloch’s driving drum pattern and Burns’ washed-out vocals, which transform an enigmatic yet evocative nine-word lyric written by Burns’ daughter (“count the roads/ Dallas eyes/ don’t breathe air”) into a personal mantra that reifies their father-daughter bond."

    "review_text": "It’s easy to be swept up by the sublime beauty of anIchiko Aobasong: Her crystalline voice and classical guitar are arresting, exuding a quiet patience that seems to lower the volume of everything around it. She’s ostensibly a folk artist, but the transfixing nature of her work feels more like sorcery, as if she were weaving spells from each filigreed guitar figure and porcelain syllable. You don’t need to know Japanese to understand her singing; her music conveys an emotional resonance that eludes description but is as familiar as muscle memory.\nIn 2020, after six striking albums of minimalist, lightly jazz-influenced folk, Aoba’s vision and instrumental palette expanded dramatically. On that year’sWindswept Adan, a concept album set on the fictional island of Adan, Aoba and her main collaborator,Taro Umebayashi, added elements like sweeping strings, synths, and field recordings to her delicate sound. The album brought Aoba, who’d developed a huge following in Japan, to international acclaim. If earlier songs were pinhole snapshots,Windswept Adanwas full of wall-sized panoramas, zooming out to capture the immensity of existence.\nOnLuminescent Creatures, Aoba’s exquisite and entrancing eighth album, she and Umebayashi further broaden their horizons. It’s a sequel of sorts toWindswept Adan, taking its name from the 2020 album’s final track. But instead of continuing that record’s storyline, Aoba examines its themes from more abstract angles, using the interconnectivity of nature to unpack life’s cosmic mysteries. The previous album’s closing track ends with a two-minute recording of waves gently crashing on a shoreline; the new record takes us below the surface. Much of Aoba’s inspiration came from visits to the Ryukyu Archipelago, which lies southwest of Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan’s four largest islands. There, she’d dive into the sea without scuba gear, going as deep as the breath in her lungs would take her. She sought the colorful array of bioluminescent beings, creatures like jellyfish, algae, and sea stars that have evolved to produce their own light within the ocean’s crushing darkness. In press materials and interviews, she’s described those dives as terrifying but beautiful, acts of submission to the environment’s boundlessness.\nThroughoutLuminescent Creatures, the vibrant arrangements position Aoba in the middle of a vast landscape. As flute and strings soar overhead like flocks of birds on opener “COLORATURA,” and while synthesizers shimmer in the distance on “SONAR,” Aoba sounds alone, her voice lightly bathed in enough reverb to draw attention to the magnitude of everything surrounding her. That solitude reads as more existential than melancholy, a comforting acknowledgement that she’s merely a blip in the infinite. OnWindswept Adan, she often blended with the instrumentation, sitting slightly below the fingerpicked nylon guitar of “Sagu Palm’s Song” or overtaken by the twinkling music-box arrangement of “Pilgrimage.” She was the imagineer of that record, weaving herself into the tale unspooling from her mind. In contrast,Luminescent Creaturesis rooted in her experiences of traveling to remote islands, swimming in the tide, and studying how weather and climate change affect coral reefs. Here, she’s in the role of observer, documenting reality rather than conjuring it from whole cloth."

    "review_text": "One of the first sounds you hear onSeeking Darkness, the debut byParannoulside project Huremic, is an elephant trumpeting. In typical fashion for this anonymous South Korean artist, the only details accompanying the album come from a scant Bandcamp description that, translated to English, reads: “This secondary work used the Korean traditional music virtual instrument sound source library developed by the Seoul National University Arts and Science Center.” A recording of an elephant is exactly what you’d expect to hear in a “sound source library,” right next to a revved engine and the Wilhelm scream. Parannoul has built a reputation for producing grandiose, full-band sounds out of mostly synth presets and MIDI programming, and the same holds true for Huremic. When the elephant sample pops up a second time, minutes after it first appears, it’s so artfully manipulated that it initially scans as free-jazz sax or squalls of guitar feedback.\nParannoul albums reach skyward, with emotional stakes that shine through even when the production embraces lo-fi garage band aesthetics. Huremic has entirely different goals.Seeking Darknessconsists of five murky, cacophonous compositions that are simply named “Seeking Darkness Pt. 1” through “Seeking Darkness Pt. 5.” Parannoul doesn’t shy away from sprawl, usually requiring at least five minutes per track; Huremic doubles that benchmark, andSeeking Darknessclocks in at the same hour-long runtime that’s become par for the course for the musician. But while marathon-length Parannoul songs like “White Ceiling” and “Evoke Me” spend their time patiently building towards well-earned climaxes, these five often gently meander or abruptly shift, and sometimes do both within the span of a couple minutes.\nThis freewheeling spirit is most effective on the first, second, and fourth tracks, the wildest of the bunch. All feature melodic instruments (or at least samples that approximate guitar, bass, and keys), but their guiding lights are percussion and noise. The drums are consistently huge, bashing away busy-but-repetitive patterns that, especially when multi-tracked, recallBoredomsat their most krautrock-y. Occasional blown-out shrieks of unidentifiable origin, too, bolster the album’s madcap mission. “Seeking Darkness Pt. 2” doesn’t reach its wildest heights until its assembly line of imposingly spartan beats give way to a glitchy freakout worthy ofSkrillex’s recentdubstep-reclamation album. Given “Pt. 4”’s harsh, guitarlike tones and its less cut-and-paste structure, you can squint and imagine Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo bashing strings with screwdrivers and drumsticks. “Seeking Darkness Pt. 1” has the most linear build of the three, but it follows one true master: that elephant sample, which gets less and less organic as it screeches and snakes its way through progressively heavier surroundings."

The big DJs are called Fingerblast and Fart in the Club; the even bigger ones weardressing gownsandhorse masks. You can launch a career by going viral in afake toiletor areal kitchen. And the future of physical media appears to be inrocks(£1,000, please). In arecent interview, Karl O’Connor and Dave Sumner proposedEnd Beginningsas an attempt to save music from “stupidity.” But the album is less dour than that declaration suggests. Sandwell District built their catalog on vast architectural space and to-the-millimeter precision; now, more than a decade since their last record,End Beginningsis the sound of the collective letting loose.\nMuch of the appeal of Sandwell District, the “techno boy band” that blew up in acrimony in 2012—there were fistfights, airline bans, and one hotel afterparty that ended only after military intervention—lay in their totalizing sense of hermetic perfection, a modernist’s Platonic ideal of what techno could be. (Their late-2010 albumFeed-Forward, reissued two years ago, remains one of the genre’s finest LPs of the 21st century.) Alongside this spellbinding purism, an unholy union ofSäkhöandCarl Craig, came an unusually striking visual style: a psychonautic peep show of jaw-headed bikers and rockabilly ghouls that helped insulate the music from the militant dullness typical of dance music’s conservative wing, for whom only mannered reserve will do.\nThe current Sandwell District lineup is missing one of its pillars: the irreplaceable DJ, producer, and visual artist Juan Mendez, akaSilent Servant, who, alongside his wife, Simone Ling, and friend Luis Vasquez,diedlast year. (O’Connor recently toldResident Advisorthat he also nearly perished earlier this year, narrowly surviving a 100 mph head-on collision.) The rust-on-white artwork forEnd Beginningsis a deliberate break from Mendez’s leather droogs and inky voids, though the title is taken from one of his unfinished artworks that had been slated for this album. In a similar spirit, some of the music also pivots away from the collective’s established jet-black forms. In an electro track like “Citrinitas Acid,” a doleful android tearjerker, O’Connor, Sumner, and their expanded roster of collaborators—among them Mønic and Rivet, who helped O'Connor and Sumner finish the LP—make fruitful tweaks to the group’s gloomy register."

    "review_text": "Thom YorkeandMark Pritchardfirst crossed paths in 2012, afterRadiohead, on a night off tour in Sydney, turned up to the dextrous producer’s festival set. The two of them chatted over dinner in a meeting that Pritchard, perhaps surprisingly,portraysas a perfectly casual affair. On the right is an inscrutable titan of art-rock, presumably shooting daggers around the room while cryptically eating a salad. On the left is the bespectacled interloper with more productionaliasesthan anyone can count, propounding a hare-brained scheme to get together and rustle up some tunes.\nBut travelers of the dance underground represented mythic figures to Yorke. By 2012, he was already several years into a self-imposed life sentence of atonement for his part in some of the greatest rock music ever made. Cult concerns likeLinkandReload—Pritchard’s sprawling constellation in the extended Warp universe—had long ago bewitched the singer, a man who still seems personally affronted that Radiohead are more popular than LFO. So “yeah, yeah,” Yorke told him. “Just send me whatever you want.”\nNearly a decade later they started work onTall Tales. By then, Pritchard had released the scenic 2016 albumUnder the Sun—featuring his first collaboration with Yorke—and evolved from a fiendish dance stylist into a mellow elder statesman. During pandemic lockdowns, Yorke took a trove of Pritchard instrumentals and gave them hell, shuffling synths and disembowelling basslines before sending it all back for review. Maybe it was lockdown fever, but Yorke saw an opportunity to take some strange vocal turns—the croaks, chirrups, siren songs, and sneering monologues of a voice forever lashing out at its inconvenient beauty. A chance, in short, for two serious musicians to limber up and have fun.\nAnd that is exactly what transpires on roughly half ofTall Tales. “The White Cliffs” takes a cosmic trip to the dark side ofAir’sMoon Safari; “The Men Who Dance in Stag’s Heads” isJoy Division’s “Atmosphere” dreaming of a medieval folk ballad, Yorke’s narrator a mysticLou Reed. “The Spirit” is a bolt of silvery joy, keyboard pulse and vocal line in rapturous harmony, life-loving lyrics spiked with only a hint of irony: “I wish you well/Pray for peace/A magic spell that sends you all to sleep.”\n“The Spirit” steals the show on track six, and the album could probably have started there. Yorke and Pritchard tinkered away onTall Talesfor some three years, which is not readily apparent in the sequencing or editing. Eight-minute opener “A Fake in a Faker’s World” is alluring but impenetrable, a union of outros asserting its right to form a song. When the ambient paean of “Ice Shelf” follows, you think: Here is a dark, grim record. “Bugging Out Again” better reflects the playfulness to come, but by the clunky “Back in the Game,” the duo’s mothballed productions feel laborious, faintly reminiscent of that awkward period whenDamon Albarnwas composingGorillazsongs on his iPad."

    "review_text": "Nothing is ever finished in aSeefeelsong. There is no final result—just a snapshot of an experiment in progress, a process in motion. Some sound like they’ve been going for a very long time—the pace glacial, galactic. We might hear a sourceless scrap of guitar, an errant drum, a lonely wisp of Sarah Peacock’s voice. A dread bass pulse the center of gravity. All these bits of shrapnel hang in tentative constellations; they drift. The forces at work are hidden from the ear: the methods arcane, the process inscrutable. The form of a given song is like a snapshot of the expanding cosmos at an arbitrary point in its evolution, a thumbnail image of infinity.\nOver the years, the UK group—currently the duo of Peacock and producer/multi-instrumentalist Mark Clifford—has offered clues as to the nature, if not the causes, of its cosmological dub. The 1995 song “Utreat,” the loneliest and most minimalist thing Seefeel had yet created, stretched like a bridge from the final side ofSuccourto the opening of the following year’s(Ch-vox), where it appeared in even more stripped-down form as “Utreat (Complete).” Three years ago, the box setRupt and Flex (1994-96)unpacked the overlapping sessions for both albums, gathering multiple versions that knocked familiar forms out of their known orbits. A drum part might lurch to the fore, or be swallowed into the distance; a smudge of old feedback might draw novel shapes against the black. In a few cases, the band seemed simply to be toying with the playback speed—slow, slower, slowest—and coaxing new frequencies out of the tape with every pass.\nSquared Rootsoffers the clearest picture yet—well, except that the pictures are blurred almost beyond recognition—of the group’s dubwise, recombinant philosophy. All seven tracks spring from the same materials that yielded this past August’sEverything Squared, which was Seefeel’s first new album in 13 years. There were six tracks there, and though the new record is about half a minute shorter, there are seven here—a minor detail that I think says something about the way Seefeel’s sounds mutate and proliferate, like bacteria in a Petri dish.\nLikeEverything Squared,Squared Rootsis about 50 percent thump, 50 percent shimmer. Dully thudding kick drums and answering swells of bass provide the frame; everything else is some abstract derivative of guitar and wordless voice, both of them stretched and smeared and dubbed beyond recognition. The guitars sound less like guitars than freight-train whistles, cool breezes, a winter sunrise; Peacock’s voice sounds less like singing than a celestial sigh. It’s impossible to describe with any kind of certainty the relationship between the earlier tracks and these new ones: Are these rough drafts or later versions? Alternate takes or actual glimpses of alternate dimensions?"

    "review_text": "There is a clarity to Ethiopian pianistEmahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru’s music that transforms her skeletal playing into founts of emotion. It permeates every song onÉthiopiques 21, the 2006 compilation that highlighted solo piano music from four of her albums. “Mother’s Love” ambles casually, frequently punctuated by circular, trilling melodies that echo the gentle and guiding hand of an attentive mother. “The Last Tears of a Deceased” traverses passages of varying turbulence, and its most emphatic moments sound like a sudden wave of tears arriving mid-reflection. These two songs, among others she composed, were dedicated to family members who passed away. It was apt that the CD began with “The Homeless Wanderer,” about a vagabond assuaging their worries through song.\nMusic always had this immediate, ineffable quality for Emahoy. After an arson attempt on her family home in Addis Ababa when she was 5, she was sent by her father—a political reformer and public intellectual—to live in Switzerland. It was there that she attended her first concert. Overcome with emotion, she approached the musician to share her gratitude; he encouraged her to play the piano, which she later took up and considered her “greatest friend” during adolescence. After Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935, she and her family were taken to various locales throughout their home country and Italy, eventually landing at a monastery in Mercogliano. Emahoy played the organ there, singing hymns with nuns. Over the next several years, her religious fervor grew, and she became a nun herself at Ethiopia’s Amba Geshen, a holy mountain said to host a fragment of the True Cross.\nEmahoy’s itinerant life and spirituality gave shape to a singular musical sensibility mixing the Western classical composers she loved (Beethoven, Chopin, Strauss) with the Ethiopian secular and sacred music that was around her. Mississippi Records’ newest dispatch,Church of Kidane Mehret, stands out among their recent string of Emahoy reissues by focusing on her most explicitly religious batch of songs. It culls from two different LPs—the 1972 album of the same name, and 1963’sDer Sang Des Meeres, which was the source for four songs onÉthiopiques—but it doesn’t reach the ecstatic highs of her best-known music. Take the longest track, the 11-minute pipe-organ epic “Via Dolorosa, XIth Station of the Cross.” Its title refers to Jesus’ crucifixion, but the drama that should be on display—of grief and hope, sorrow and glory—is nowhere to be found. Chords progress in a steady fashion, the dynamic range is limited, and every note congeals into a vague mush of sacrosanct verve."

    "review_text": "Picture this: You’re lying face down on your bed on a beautiful spring afternoon; you haven’t opened the curtains in days. Your phone is on Do Not Disturb—not that anyone’s texting you anyway, you’ve been such a bummer sinceshedumped you—with one caveat: You’ll answer the ring, allow it to disrupt your endless wallowing, if the voice on the other line belongs to her.\nAlien Boymake music for precisely this scenario, and the dozens of John Hughes-ian permutations that remind us why we call it acrush. In the world of Alien Boy, infatuation is dire, existential, and all-consuming. Why love at all, they ask, if you aren’t going to commit yourself completely? Since its inception in 2015, the Portland, Oregon four-piece has paired a sense of infinite longing with guitars that seem to stretch out forever, warped by chorus and reverb until they, too, become all-consuming, a dream-like sound befitting a band living in a romantic fantasy. On their third album,You Wanna Fade?, Alien Boy fill out the corners of their cinematic vision, layering synthesizers and drum machines atop their three-guitar swirl.\nFrom the outset, Alien Boy’s melodies sound grander, their songs more ambitious and widescreen, than on previous records. The instrumental opener “Scrub Me Clean” is something like an overture, a gossamer web of tambourines and kick drums, guitars and synthesized strings, and bleeps that recall the cheerful chirp of a touch-tone telephone. Wordlessly, it captures an ecstatic despair, the same kind of melodramatic rush one might feel listening to the first 10 seconds of “How Soon Is Now?” on a continuous loop, before the guitars swell and crash into “Changes.”\nWith three guitarists—lead vocalist and lyricist Sonia Weber, along with Caleb Misclevitz and A.P. Fiedler—Alien Boy’s sound seems to expand and contract at a moment’s notice, shifting from breezy jangle pop to soaring solos on “Changes,” constructing towering walls of reverb on “Cold Air,” wielding feedback like a weapon on “Another Brand New Me.” Small flourishes—the Mellotron on “Morning”; more buzzing bleeps on “You Want Me Too”—carve out brief respites from the pedal-laden layers of guitar that dominate the album. At just under 45 minutes,You Wanna Fade?is by far Alien Boy’s longest record; hooks feel harder fought, verses give way to guitar solos as shouted choruses. But these are welcome expansions and experiments for a band that has spent the past decade distilling power-pop heartbreak down to its essence.\nAs a lyricist, Weber has a knack for knowing how to twist the knife deeper into her own heart. On “Pictures of You,” she’s hearing phantom phone calls and praying her crush will drop by unannounced, living in a fantasy because it’s easier than admitting the loneliness of the truth. The forthrightness in her writing undercuts any attempt at irony. She admits to every petty desire on “Cold Air”; screams, “I broke my world/I broke it for you,” on “I Broke My World”; is coming “undone” on “Another Brand New Me.” As a result, even an extravagantly emo line about hating change on “Everything Stays” or a mouthful of a verse on “Changes” feels of a piece with the project as a whole."

It was a fittingly chill pick-up from a luxury label known for flashy silver jewelry and jeans that vibe more withPlayboi Carti. But like Clark Kent throwing on a pair of specs to blend in with the masses, MIKE’s newTony Seltzer-producedPinball IIdemonstrates how even indie hip-hop’s superhero sometimes hangs up his cape to make some viciously fun flex raps on his own terms.\nWhen MIKE first emerged in the 2010s, his pensive coming-of-age raps sharply contrasted the hyperactive, ethereal energy of clout-goggled SoundCloud rap contemporaries. But since then, MIKE’s music has brightened under a spotlight that’s turned him into an underground icon on par with mentorEarl Sweatshirt.Pinball IIdoesn’t boast Opium-style rage beats or radio-ready singles ripe for aWeekndfeature; instead MIKE shares a recipe for rock-star aura on “WYC4,” where slowly dripped raps weave a come-up story about rejecting the hustler’s lifestyle to grind for the rap money that earned him “Cartier like Playboi.” Like most MIKE songs, there’s just one verse effortlessly tied together with a fleeting hook. It’s up to Seltzer’s ear-rattling distorted bass and intergalactic synths to elevate MIKE’s matter-of-fact raps to nearly the same heights as the rocket ship producerHarry Fraudcommanded on Carti’s “Location.”\nIf there’s any beatmaker prepared to counter the viral narrative that the pit at a MIKE show is a place toread a bookorplay chess, it’s Brooklyn-based Seltzer, who electrified last year’sPinball. By the time Seltzer first linked with MIKE on 2017’sMay God Bless Your Hustle, he was already orchestrating a generation of local New York talent with beats that could turn tiny Brooklyn DIY venues intoTravis Scott-esque rage pits. Whether it washigh-octane drill slapsfor Brooklyn outfit Gloss Gang,ghoulish beatsfor Lower East Side tread rap demon Trippjones, orgothic trap balladsfor Uptown Manhattan’s Vinny Fanta, a “Hey Tony” tag promised to shake the room as hard as any 2016XXLFreshman.

    "review_text": "On the opening track ofSTARS, Joey Meland offers something of a mission statement for their projectCocojoey: “Too many more directions to go and I just don’t know how to pick a path.” They sing these lines gently at first, over a placid keyboard fantasia, but over the course of the track’s three-minute runtime, the delicate melodies build into black metal screams. The synths contort into acid-damaged drum’n’bass, then tilt-a-whirl prog-rock and feverish showtunes that feel like they’re ripped fromAll That Jazz’s deranged death dreams. It’s unrelentingly paced and overstuffed with ideas; with each successive track, it feels like Meland is trying to push the gas pedal even further through the floor.\nMeland has always approached music with this twitchy restlessness. They learned to play the piano at age four, then darted deliriously between genres, recording classical compositions, black metal, and noise before graduating from high school. They earned a degree in composition and spent a decade playing in bands around Chicago, shifting between jazz, folk music, and funk—trying a bit of everything without committing to anything in particular. Then, during COVID lockdown, they took a pause from their busy schedule and experienced what they describe as a “spiritual transformation.” It led to a new clarity of purpose and the birth of Cocojoey—an exuberant, genre-smashing solo project that looks back at the disparate threads of their past and asks: What if instead of spreading themselves thin across all these projects, they did it all at the same time?\nOn their previous full-length,Cocojoey’s World, Meland emerged with an oozy, embryonic version of the sound: gnarled riffs clawing their way out of video game synths like chestbursters on the Nostromo. For all its scattershot psychedelia,STARS—Cocojoey’s first album for the similarly genre-obliterating label Hausu Mountain—feels more practiced and purposeful. The frayed fibers of Meland’s interests are never more delicately woven together than on “COCOJOEY’S LACK OF REGRETS,” on which they dart between queasy sound design, fusion-y piano runs, dead-eyed rapping, and guttural death metal affectations. The track also features some twisted guitar work from recurring collaboratorFire-Toolz, whose presence may help overwhelmed listeners understand just what kind of jittery, otherworldly sounds Meland is employing. Like Fire-Toolz’s vibrantly overstimulating records,STARStoys with both devastating heaviness and cerebral prog nerdiness in a way that feels both considered and playful. Both collaborators build the component parts of their tracks like intricate Lego sculptures, then smash them together and giggle at the wreckage."

    "review_text": "On first listen, it’s tempting to hearLonely People With Poweras a course correction—or even a retreat.Deafheaven’s fifth album, the tunefulInfinite Granite, turned the band’s carefully constructed aesthetic on its head; it sits in their discography like a polished gem in a crate of jagged boulders. It was a big swing for a group once renowned for its overwhelming power, and a keen observer might have noticed that rooms on theInfinite Granitetour were a bit emptier, and praise from critics a littlemore measured. Performing live, vocalist George Clarke had long appeared superhuman, but as a singer, he sometimes lost his footing. It was all a bit humbling for a band that had seemed invincible ever since dropping itsgenre-exploding breakthrough.\nLonely People With Powermarks a return to Deafheaven’s comfort zone: tortured screams, blast beats, songs that build toward crescendos like 747s lifting off the runway. On the surface, it most resemblesNew Bermuda, the dark, muscular album where Deafheaven sought to bolster their metal bona fides. But onLonely People With Power, they’re in a very different headspace. Many of the tracks here consolidate their strengths in search of a hybrid approach—a way to integrate, rather than reject the brighter sounds ofInfinite Granite. While the song structures are arguably their most pop-oriented to date (eight of the 12 songs clock in at under six minutes—bite-sized, by Deafheaven standards), some of the sounds and themes rank among the most confrontational in the band’s discography. This might be the first Deafheaven record that doesn’t significantly rework the formula, but even so, the band can’t help but eye new terrain.\nLike most Deafheaven records,Lonely People With Poweropens thunderously. Following a brief, atmospheric intro, “Doberman” charges out of the gate with a relentless beat and compresses the band’s many talents—wandering basslines, EBow atmospherics, wanton shredding—into an unusually tight package. “Magnolia” is Deafheaven for actual metalheads: four straight minutes of crash-cymbal hits and palm-muted guitars with no pretty parts to speak of. “The Garden Route” plays like anOrdinary Corrupt Human Loveouttake, layering Clarke’s growling voice over an expanse of clean, ringing guitars.\nWith the fan service out of the way, “Heathen” tries something new: tempering the dark pop ofInfinite Granitewith heavy yet anthemic choruses. The song finds a satisfying balance before locking into a lumbering groove in its final section; as the tempo quickens, Clarke lets his voice stretch out over each word, adding as much texture to the music as Kerry McCoy and Shiv Mehra’s dreamy washes of guitar. As an assertion of strengths that expands their dynamic range, “Heathen” feels miles ahead of anything onInfinite Granite."

    "review_text": "Shortly before founding his jangle quartetthe Tubs, Owen Williams poured himself into a very different passion project: a prickly novel inspired by the suicide of his mother, folk singer and writerCharlotte Greig. “It was 2016 and the Trauma Industrial Complex was revving into gear,” Williams explained ina Substack post; “I wanted to be exploited too.” Alas, he recounts, the market was not as ripe for his style of unsentimental grief as he’d anticipated. Every agent passed on the book, and he did not take the rejection well: “There’s a special kind of humiliation in failing to hawk your big tragedy.”\nThe light at the end of his spiral of sleepless, Xanax-addicted months came in part from the unexpected success of the Tubs, who were attracting interest beyond the niche corners that still get excited about a new jangle-pop album. After the warm reception to the band’s dourly tuneful 2023 debutDead Meat, the idea nagged at Williams: Perhaps there might be a back door to repurpose a little bit of the novel that nobody wanted. He found that the songs for the Tubs’ follow-upCotton Crowncame quickly.\nCotton Crowndoesn’t shy from the inherent discomfort of the subject matter. That’s the artist’s mother on the album cover, breastfeeding a newborn Williams in a graveyard in a black and white photo originally used for one of her 7\"s. The closing song, “Strange,” includes an anecdote about a stranger grabbing Williams’ arm at his mother’s wake and suggesting he could write a song about it, an origin story he appendixes with an apology (“Well, whoever the hell you are/I’m sorry, I guess this is it”). “The Thing Is” opens the record with the kind of self-loathing endemic of somebody who’s going through too much shit to be any good in a relationship.\nThe difference between a sad song and a sad novel, of course, is that given their in-and-out nature, sad songs aren’t nearly as suffocating—especially not the way the Tubs’ play them. In spite of Williams’ glum lyrics and cold, stricken voice, the music always chugs along merrily. “Freak Mode” barrels forward with the pep ofBob Mouldat his most frolicksome, while the jubilant \"Narcissist\" rings out withJohnny Marrchime. Even Williams’ dispatches from the deepest throes of depression are played as absolute romps. “Somehow sitting in my empty room/Is the only thing I wanna do,” Williams sings on “Illusion” over rollicking pub rock.\nAs always, guitarist George Nicholls and backing vocalist Lan McArdle serve as the sugar and creamer to Williams’ black coffee. (McArdle, William’s past bandmate inJoanna Gruesomeand present one inEx-Vöid, isn’t a full member of the Tubs, yet their harmonies are so integral to the pleasure that it’s difficult to imagine their albums without them.) IfDead Meatplayed like a lost IRS Records release from 1987,Cotton Crownplays like one from 1988—a touch clearer, a touch more refined, perhaps, but fundamentally of a piece. The album’s improbable feat is that, even with its inherent tragedy,Cotton Crownis somehow an even breezier, more agreeable listen. It’s not often that sorrow goes down so easily.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "“Romanticize your life,” the TikTok girlies tell you, urging you to add whimsy to your breakfast routine, spritz perfume liberally, and practice gratitude. All fine suggestions, though I’ve found the simplest way to idealize the world is just to pay attention to it. Step outside in late November, when the cold air carries the smell of distant bonfires and the insides of strangers’ houses appear to burn with light, and you might feel yourself slip into a kind of rapture. Your fingers start to tingle, edges begin to blur; you romanticize the world by sublimating yourself into it.\nAlternatively, you might look to the ocean. “On our watery planet, we return to the sea for a diagnosis of our current condition,” wrote the criticDavid Toopin 1995’sOcean of Sound, a shape-shifting meditation on ambient music. “Submersion into deep and mysterious pools represents an intensely romantic desire for dispersion into nature, the unconscious, the womb, the chaotic stuff of which life is made.” We arrive, over and over, to the sea as metaphor—for the unconscious mind, vast networks of information, and music, which evokes the ocean’s formlessness, the way it moves, and how it makes us feel.\nEssential Mixtape, a full-length collaboration between the French producerMalibuand the Swedish producerMerely, opens with nearby birdsong, the flick of a lighter or a tape recorder, and the sound of driving: fast air, tires on gravel, a turn signal’s metronome. We hear soft voices whispering about colors: “The purple sky... The ocean blue... The fire red...” A synth pad shimmers in the background, translucent as water, as the conversation continues: “Dawn blue... sun yellow...” “No, we don’t need more yellow.” A car window is lowered, and suddenly we hear the ocean crash against the earth—a split second of chaos, fading as the current ebbs from shore.\nThe two friends recorded the mixtape on a trip through southern Sweden: layering field recordings with samples, airy synths, clouds of reverb, and vocals stretched and slowed to sound like angels crying. In their respective solo work, both Malibu and Merely repurpose pop melodies into moody compositions that at a glance appear unstructured—songs that ache with romance and value feeling over form. There is an obvious kinship between the wistfuleditsMerely posts on Bandcamp and the sample-based euphoria of Malibu’s alter egos, from herdj lostboiproject to her work asbelmont girl, pairing quick edits with dreamy lo-fi footage of headlights on a rainy highway, city lights seen from a plane, or an abandoned beach house being pulled into the sea."

I bring this up because, if we’re to take frontperson Bea MacDonald at her word,Hunting Seasonis a concept record of 13 songs where 13 Elvis impersonators die in a 13-car pileup. Then again,The Whalerwasn’treallyabout 9/11 nor wasI Became Birdsreallyabout Scientology, as the band has claimed. Those were simply metaphorical frameworks to explore the two things that Home Is Where songs are most often about: a desire for profound transformation and the disappointment that can come when nothing actually changes. Gender transition, cult success, and moving to New York didn’t change the essence of Home Is Where prior toHunting Season,and even after their evolution into shit-kicking, truck-driving bards of weird Americana, they’re thrilled to still sound a lot like themselves.\nHome Is Where have unexpectedly found themselves amidst arising tide of artistspivoting out of punk into alt-country—or, at the very least, the raw elements of alt-country. The band who invented the deeply, deeply online fifth-wave emo taxonomy has spent the past three years immersed in the canon ofNeil Young,Flying Burrito Brothers, andGram Parsons, while recognizing that Alan Jackson might belong there, too. It’s very possible that “Chattahoochee” inspired MacDonald to make a chorus out of “Loxahatchee” on “The Wolf Man,” though the feral nature and suburban dullness of an uncaged safari park in West Palm Beach makes for a perfect Home Is Where image in its own right.\nTheir pivot is surprising in its extent, rather than its direction. Whether it was the honking harmonica solos of “Long Distance Conjoined Twins” orThe Whaler’sredneck roots-rock outlier “Daytona 500,” Home Is Where have never fully covered their tracks as a North Florida band equally raised on I Hate Myself and Bob Dylan. ForHunting Season,the blackened screamo howls and barbed tapping solos have softened into rebel yells and kudzu-like leads, while the singing saw solos are now more likely to be played on pedal steel. The ACAB flamethrowing of 2021’s “Assisted Harakiri” has also turned inward onHunting Seasonopener “Reptile House,” as its narrator sets themselves on fire in front of their boss—not to take down the system, but to maintain a shred of dignity rather than being doomed to the same fate as any of the animals roaming the Florida wetlands on the ensuing “Migration Patterns.” “I’d never want to live forever/I’d still have to go to work,” MacDonald yelps, one of many punchlines onHunting Seasonthat works equally well within Home Is Where’s hard-left politics as on Cracker Barrel merch."

    "review_text": "Salami Rose Joe LouisisCaptain Beefheartfor synth heads who grew up watching Adult Swim. She debuted in a punk band playing the blender (as in the household appliance). She named her first albumSon of a Sauce!, her secondZlaty Sauce Nephew. She then followed those, naturally, with a handful of grand sci-fi concept albums.\nBefore she was Salami Rose Joe Louis, Lindsay Olsen was a scientist studying the ocean’s acidity. During lab breaks, she’d tinker away at the piano, finding alliances between molecular forms and chord sequences. Nowadays, her music might best be described, per one of her song titles, as “giddy aquatic.” Her songs mimic the inky materiality of the sea: Globules of sound bubble in the low end then reach some mirrored surface—melodies ascending, cresting high, then returning.\nOlsen composes almost entirely on a charmingly démodé Roland MV-8800 workstation, and her early-digital sound evinces aStereolab-like talent for repurposing technological kitsch into her own lingua franca: a wave of cartoonish blurps, cheeky voicings, and complex free-form melodies. But the highly ambitious—though ultimately overwrought—sci-fi narratives of her recent releases obscured her talent beneath interdimensional travelogs, talking clouds, and bionic humanoids. On her new albumLorings, she strips back the galactic props and trades cosmological conjecture for inward contemplation. The music is much stronger for it.\nLoringsreveals Olsen’s endearing bashfulness, much like the peeking smile she wears on the album’s cover. Her vocals are softly fitful; the songs are never louder than a finch’s call. Olsen’s lyrics, though stuttering, communicate a much clearer insight than before. Here, the songs stand on their own merits, each a calm riot of skill and invention.\nOlsen’s spongy, rosy pads make the album feel balmy and mellow upon first blush. ButLoringsreveals itself to be far more itchy and restless on further inspection: the product of someone trying to hush an overactive imagination. On “Motorway” and “I dunno ways,” Olsen periodically disrupts precise, slow-moving melodies with experimental gambits. Lounge synths come into collision with free jazz. “That must be hard for you” sounds like the jazz fusion of CASIOPEA if they made music quiet enough not to disturb their roommates.\nLoringsis an exquisite balancing act, encapsulating big ideas within small frames. The music possesses a clean fidelity without negating any of its homespun charm. Olsen’s resplendent atmospheres don’t feel panoramic but more like a contained brightness. The staccato chords of “Hobbies” gesture towards the anthemic but stay closed within the tight walls of the song, like moonlight filtering into a shoebox apartment. The album’s sequencing itself is weighted neatly between hecticness and lethargy.Lorings’first half is a sensory playground. “A sauna sized pill,” the most frenetic among the bunch, is as sprightly as it comes: the sound of a million rubber eggs let loose in a wind tunnel. The backend slows down, all pulse and shimmer. It sets the stage for the most impactful and unburnished lyric on “Wet Log”: “I called my mom and asked/Does this sadness last?”"

    "review_text": "AnnahstasiaEnuke couldn’t become the star her early handlers wanted her to be. As a teenager, the Los Angeles-raised model, guitarist, and folk singer signed to a label that pushed her toward pop and R&B, genres that fit her like a straitjacket. Her vocal coaches tried to change her voice into something it wasn’t, she’ssaid: “All of them wanted to craft my voice into something more acrobatic, something squeezed, tight and maneuverable.” Annahstasia eventually got out of her deal and started releasing songs that foregrounded her husky natural timbre.\nWhen Annahstasia sings, she makes use of her full range, but her low end is where the magic happens. Her warm, resonant purr makes you acutely aware of the body shaping the air—as though her experiences, dreams, and fears lurked right there in her chest. That singular instrument guides her debut album,Tether, a self-possessed set that straddles folk, rock, and chamber pop. These songs hit like tractor beams, lifting you up and suspending you in their charged dramas.\nThe record is produced by Andrew Lappin (L’Rain,Cassandra Jenkins), Jason Lader (Julian Casablancas), and Aaron Liao (Raveena,Moses Sumney), who supply warm, largely acoustic arrangements that flutter and swell around Annahstasia’s breathy croon. Drums appear sparingly; Liao’s basslines and Annahstasia’s cadences more often than not set the pace, which tends to be slow. The compositions flow like breath: Guitars, pianos, and other instruments flood the mix, fade out of it, then return. The flux makes the music feel lush and airy, lively but also poised.\nBoth modes suit Annahstasia’s tales of relationships at the tipping point. “I’m porcelain/Sitting on your highest shelf/I’m gonna fall/I’m gonna fall without your help/Take care of me/Before anyone else,” Annahstasia pleads on “Take Care of Me,” teetering in her upper register. The delicacy of the imagery and her singing blunt the distrust behind the caveat, “before anyone else.” Romance is just as fraught on the yearning “Unrest,” where domestic bliss is undercut by the “unrest/Sitting in my chest.” Over fingerpicked guitars worthy ofNick Drake, she muses, “When we sit alone/We don’t hear the alarms/’Cause when you love me/There can’t be any harm.” Beneath the song’s rapturous surface, doubts proliferate:When, she repeats, the bliss conditional.\nAnnahstasia’s vocal repertoire is stunning. Her singing is expressive even when it is clipped, direct even when distant. With no further scene-setting, she can spin complicated tales out of the starkest couplet—“I still hear your voice inside my head/Say that I’m the villain of the story”—aided by nothing more than the nuances of her enunciation, her voice catching on every pained syllable. ButTethershowcases her command of timing above all. “The longer that I stare/At this ghetto diamond/I find it rare and different/This pile of memories/That were always lying there,” she sings on opener “Be Kind,” her vibrato stretching “rare” and “there” into quivering little hearts. The pause between the last two lines draws out the ambivalence inscribed in her imagery."

Though that may sound like an expression of regret, Hadreas sang it with a kind of guarded optimism—opening a door into a record that gleefully documented life’s contradictions through odes to connections to the self and others.\nOnGlory, Perfume Genius’ latest, Haderas is once again mulling the grand arc of his existence. He ponders “my entire life…” on “No Front Teeth” before pausing. Then, he confesses: “It’s fine.” On the nervy, agoraphobic “It’s a Mirror,” he admits, “My whole life is/Open just outside the door.” He’s isolated, stuck inside his own agonizing thought patterns, and he knows something more appealing—immensely gratifying, even—isright there. But he isn’t sure he can reach it.\nGlorytraffics in these moments of desperation and alienation, themes that are not entirely new territory for Hadreas. Much of the album was written during COVID lockdown, the forced retreat compelling Hadreas to confront the way personal baggage doesn’t inevitably recede with age. “Being out in the world is really terrifying to me,” heexplained toThe Guardian.“I was trying to confront a lot of that—like how do I engage, how do I be inside of my relationships, inside of the world, a part of things more, even though I’m scared?” We’re now five years out from the start of that collective claustrophobia, when many of us were forced into uncomfortably close quarters with our own psyches, and our current moment doesn’t lack for art about its effects. Thankfully,Glorydoesn’t take the pandemic as its subject. Instead, it brings a new perspective to themes that have long tugged at Hadreas: anxiety, grief, disconnection. The sensation of being trapped inside one’s own mind, wanting desperately to shed one’s immaturity and re-engage more generously with the world: This is, unfortunately, a timeless concern, and here, Hadreas renders it in the detailed, moody technicolor he’s mastered.\nGloryis rich with beauty, but the band—Hadreas; longtime partner Alan Wyfells; producerBlake Mills; and drummers Tim Carr and Jim Keltner, bassist Pat Kelly, and guitaristsMeg Duffyand Greg Uhlmann—twists it just enough to let in flashes of the strange and idiosyncratic. An insistent, buzzing synth interrupts the transcendence of “Left for Tomorrow”; “Clean Heart” balances twitchy percussion and incandescent keys; “In a Row” thrums mischievously. A third of the way through “No Front Teeth,” the song drops its restrained elegance and becomes a full-band thrash; later, it repeats that trick again, the band fading out and leaving onlyAldous Harding’s exquisite voice before swerving back to strummed guitars and an eerie swirl of synths. Its whiplash is delicious, like a rollercoaster where the amazement of the peak is only matched by the thrill of seeing the universe turned upside-down a moment later."

    "review_text": "SHERELLEis more than just a DJ; she’s a scholar. BBC Radio calls upon the British artist to dissect theinfluence of the Amen Break, possibly electronic music’s most omnipresent sample. Through her organizationBeautiful, she hosts events about Black and queer communities’ foundational role in the history of dance music and offers free studio time to up-and-coming producers. Before her2019 Boiler Room setwent viral and earned her international acclaim among breakbeat and jungle enthusiasts, she even had a stint at Mixmag, making videos exploring the dusty annals of DJ culture. Point being, SHERELLE knows her shit. This expansive knowledge forms the basis ofWITH A VENGEANCE, her much-anticipated, surprise-drop debut album that marries just about every genre under the 160bpm umbrella into 10 tight, adrenaline-pumping tracks.\nIn the hands of a less talented producer, a project that frenetically shifts from footwork to drum ’n’ bass to jungle might sound overstuffed; here, the range serves to showcase SHERELLE’s savvy. As it stands, the record is exhilarating rather than exhausting. On the title track, acid house sirens wail menacingly before one of the album’s dozens of breakbeats jitters into the mix like machine-gun fire blasting at the doors of your underground bunker. The title “WITH A VENGEANCE” is apt—at times it feels like SHERELLE isn’t making music for you so much asatyou, strapping you into a roller coaster of her own design with no emergency brake.\nThe rapidly pulsating “DON’T WANT U” also exemplifies SHERELLE’s propensity for raw, unfiltered production; the track’s intensity steadily ratchets up thanks to bouncing bass and itchy hi-hats until the beat drops and a voice ferociously exclaims, “I don’t need you no more!” Sometimes, sample work on jungle or drum ’n’ bass records can come off as tongue-in-cheek, even bordering on campy, but SHERELLE’s masterful selections imbueWITH A VENGEANCEwith an unexpected emotionality. “XTC”’s elated sample conjures not only the drug the title references but the light-headed joy of falling in love: Behind classic jungle flourishes and 8-bit keyboard blips, the up-pitched vocal “in love, yeah/Ecstasy!” reverberates into space. While the album is most certainly designed for the dancefloor, you’re left with the impression that blowing the roof off the club is the secondary objective here. Through her meticulous examination of these particular high-speed dance genres, SHERELLE crafts something deeply personal, as narrative and feeling-forward as hip-hop or R&B.\nThe most blatant instance of this is “FREAKY (JUST MY TYPE),” the album’s only vocal track, where SHERELLE enlists newcomer George Riley for a sugar-coated house-pop song as indebted to breakbeat as sultry ’90s R&B. Riley’s exuberant soprano soars above a caffeinated garage beat, until the song’s midway point, where the uptempo drive briefly gives way to almost balearic synth chords plucked straight from the first cracks of dawn at a euphoric beach rave. “FREAKY” is the album’s most radio-friendly moment, but as the track progresses, SHERELLE steers it decidedly back towards the DJ booth, stretching out its last minutes with rolling jungle beats and layered vocal runs. The album’s subsequent tracks—the driving acid techno of “READY, STEADY, GO!”, the madcap hardcore of “SPEED (ENDURANCE)”, the static-drenched footwork of “XTC SUSP9ND3D” —spelunk even deeper into the dank clubs where these sounds originated. This mood culminates with the penultimate track, “LOVE YOUR ENEMIES,” which layers spoken-word samples in patois with plaintive saxophones courtesy of London producer Cameo Blush."

    "review_text": "The club is traditionally the place where you can escape all the problems in your life and the world at large, but it’s whereEla Minusgoes to confront them. On her 2020 full-length debut,acts of rebellion, the Colombian producer drew upon her eclectic musical CV—Bogotá hardcore kid, Berklee-trained jazz musician, techno convert, touring drummer for electro-goth queenAustra, professional synth builder—to make an album that channeled the communal joy of dance music and hedonistic allure of subterranean after-hours spaces into punky protest music. But if that record’s collection of misfit mantras and anti-capitalist critique transformed the dancefloor into a pulpit, Minus’ second album,DÍA, uses it more like a confession booth.\nFor Minus, the period surroundingacts of rebellionwas one of both celebration and dislocation. Just before the album was released to international acclaim, Minus had to give up her Brooklyn apartment and recording space due to financial constraints during COVID lockdown. She’d spend the next few years bouncing between Bogotá, Mexico City, L.A., Seattle, New York, and London, desperate to find a new place that felt like home while feeling the pressure to capitalize on the career momentum sparked by her debut. By the time she was able to piece together a new album, she realized the songs weren’t speaking to her, prompting an 11th-hour rewrite that better reflected her unsettled state of mind. That extra time and attention pays off massively withDÍA, an album that pushes Minus’ musical vision outward while burrowing deeper inward lyrically. Likeacts of rebellion, the album carves out a safe space for outsiders to harness strength in numbers, but trades in the DIY basement-club vibe for the open-air expanse of a festival field. And while it retains her debut’s insurrectionary edge,DÍArecognizes that self-care is a crucial first step toward building a better world for all.\nOf course, the first step toward self-care is admitting that you need it. InDÍA’s opening minutes, Minus emerges fromacts of rebellion’s nocturnal netherworld, capturing the sobering sensation of a sunrise hitting your face after a night spent dancing in the shadows. Musically, “Abrir Monte” picks up where the joyous second half ofJamie xx’s “Gosh” left off, with a low-end two-chord pattern serving as the backdrop for a cluster of synth starbursts, while flickering beats conjure a city gearing up for the morning rush. The track doubles as the extended intro to “Broken,” a cry for help that swells into a soul-purifying baptism-by-rave and seamlessly fuses Minus’ artful idiosyncrasies with emergent dance-pop ambitions. Call it “Fever Rayof Light.”"

    "review_text": "John Martynwas, in every way, a hard man to pin down. He was a gregarious, rambunctious guy who loved to booze and brawl—he beat up Sid Vicious after the punk singer insulted him during a poker game. Equally talented as a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, he wasn’t quite virtuosic at any one of these things. He was an integral member of the flourishing and shaggy British folk movement of the late 1960s and early ’70s, yet his most acclaimed music can’t really be characterized as “folk” at all. His plainspoken lyrics aren’t as idiosyncratic asRichard Thompson’smordant dramaor his close friendNick Drake’stender eloquence, to name a couple of his contemporaries. So what makes Martyn special? It’s his unmatched ability to tap into a specific aspect of music-making, one whose cultural currency has peaked in recent years. Martyn was the master ofvibes.\nTo pedants and spoilsports, “vibes” is either a meaningless word or an expression of meaninglessness, a rhetorical crutch of the inarticulate to convey aesthetics, charisma, or energy. But vibes are real. As professor Tom F. Wrightargues inTheAtlantic,the term has roots in the 19th century, “older esoteric traditions that described social relations as ‘vibratory,’” later revived via the “good vibrations” of the hippies in the ’60s. For Martyn, “vibes” undoubtedly describes an ineffable mood or sensibility, a “tune in, turn on, drop out” mindset undergirding a preternatural cool. Yet it’s also music full of actual vibrations—keyboard twinkles, frenetic woody basslines, scuttling percussion, and reverberating cyclones of guitar strums, unmoored and seemingly levitating in the ether, coiled by a burly, warm voice slurring words into splatters and smears.\nIt’s a testament to Martyn’s technique and fundamental training that this circuitous architecture never sounds remotely off-putting or inaccessible. In his music you can hear the autumnal warmth of Nick Drake, the soul-searching intensity ofVan Morrison, thekaleidoscopic explorationof electricMiles Davis, and as Martyn frequently acknowledged, the clacking, searing earth-fire ofPharoah Sanders. What all these artists share is an astral perspective, a supernatural ability to divine music that soars in atmospheric planes. For Drake it was an Orphic sense of the elysian; for Morrison it was repetition as a means of attaining the mystical. Yet where Drake and Morrison projected inward, and where Davis and Sanders billowed outward, Martyn’s music seems to move from the inside out, or omnidirectionally. But it’s not “free”—it has structure and melody, intimacy and soft edges. It possesses a quality that is hard to isolate or map. It’s just… vibes!"

    "review_text": "AsBlue Lake, Jason Dungan makes music that crosshatches two disparate genres: the distinctly American, experimental guitar records made by artists likeYasmin WilliamsandSteve Gunn; and what might be called the “new Danish scene,” populated by avant-garde songwriters includingAstrid SonneandML Buch. But Dungan doesn’t fit neatly in either category; the Copenhagen-via-Dallas composer and artist is an inventive traditionalist at heart, crafting a blend of drone, folk, and ambient that feels attuned to his Texan home—with riffs that sound like old country ditties—despite being made an ocean away. Billed as a “mini-album” preceding an as-yet unannounced larger release, his latest,Weft, is a snapshot of the Blue Lake project in motion as it further braids together masterful precision and naturalistic experimentation.\nWeftbegins almost exactly where Dungan’s 2023 debut album,Sun Arcs, left off, setting his beloved nylon string guitar atop a bed of cello and gently brushed drums. Like water flowing from one eddy to another, he’ll catch a melodic refrain, spend a few bars with it, then move on to the next. The album’s title refers to the work of Dugan’s partner, Maria Zahle, a weaver and textile artist whose piece “Torso” appears on the cover. Its individual strands of colored thread, barely affixed to the cloth beneath, serve as a handy visual metaphor for how Dungan gently ushers sounds—including piano, melodica, and 12-string guitar, all of which appear more frequently and prominently here than onSun Arcs—in and out of the mix, making his arrangements feel populous, but never cluttered.\nThis expanded instrumentation is put to its greatest effect onWeft’s longer compositions. “The Forest” broadly follows a linear progression of build, climax, and denouement, but its magic moment comes right before the two-minute mark, when crystalline treble tones cohere, at the entrance of a bass riff, into something resembling a classic pop song. Meanwhile, the live-recorded “Tartara” features the only musicians other than Dungan to appear on the album and is, appropriately, far more meandering. Named for a volcano in the Chilean Andes studied by his geologist father, the meditative, drone-adjacent piece includes found percussion, courtesy of Dungan, that evokes the crackle of sparks in the air—like a campfire singalong composed for neo-classical quartet.\nDespite radiating a gentle, unassuming tranquility,Weftrarely bores. Part of that can be credited to the engineering work of Jeff Zeigler (a past collaborator of fellow zither savant Laraaji), who lovingly draws attention to each instrument: a piano flourish here, a flute line there. It’s also due to Dungan’s own creative playfulness, which extends beyond his recorded music to include running the creative residency space Polychrome alongside Zahle and designing his own custom zithers. One such creation—this time with 36 strings—is the sole instrument on “Strata,”Weft’s spare closing note. It’s a joy to hear Dungan’s approach: all the giddiness of a child with a new toy, and all the skill of the man who made the toy himself."

As1000000000s, he manipulatedTaylor Swiftsongs intopiss-taking ephemera. On 2022’sBlood Karaoke, he combined YouTube videos into mystery-bag collages. These works are a far cry from his collaborations, whether as the drummer forBig Thiefor as a session musician for pop stars like Swift,Ed Sheeran, andGracie Abrams. But his debut solo LP for Planet Mu,Performing Belief, feels like a big deal: His dance music is more serious, stripped of irony and impish glee, and he’s brought inJoshua AbramsandSam Wilkesto flesh out the sound. He offers a litany of styles here, most of which fall into a sort of pan-global, folktronica-adjacent microhouse. There’s only one problem: It has no verve.\nWhilePerforming Beliefis a new tack for Krivchenia, he’s made music like this for years, the kind that has the germ of an idea but doesn’t know what to do with it. Take “Undesigned,” which opens the album with a barrage of drum patterns that sort of just exist. It is strange to hear a song meander for five minutes without providing catharsis, a sense of propulsion, or a coherent atmosphere. At times, he stumbles on batida-like rhythms, but it scans as happenstance, recalling the way the sketches on 2018’sNo Commentgesture at pointillistic trance and caustic noise without capturing either’s ecstasy. Even tracks with more robust arrangements are frustratingly indifferent towards structure. “Bracelets for Unicorns” starts as an improvised jam session that coalesces into a groove, but then Krivchenia hurls field recordings and synth stabs with reckless abandon. He’s having fun, sure, but his joy only translates to haphazard tedium.\nPerforming Beliefis partly built on Krivchenia’s own collection of field recordings, but their commingling with electronic sounds is slapdash and undercooked. “Filling in the Swamp” throws in a bed of relaxing nature sounds and calls it a day—the layering proves shallow. “Metaphoric Leakage” fares better because its lapping waves are integrated with the music; their loping rhythm offers a welcome, if awkward, counterpoint to the bobbing reggae-like instrumentation. This is not so different from how a lot of these songs are constructed. Often, Krivchenia presents flashy sonic elements—like the dubstep bassline on “The Wounded Place,” or the stuttering vocal sample on “Probably Wizards”—without capitalizing on their textural and rhythmic potential. He’s too cavalier with these tracks, his ambitions ending in a hodgepodge of varied sounds."

No, Lunchbox isn’t splicingMiles Davisand Wynton Marsalis horn samples between the whirring synths (though in an2023 interview, he claimed some of the beats had a “saxophone” presence). But in an underground middle class filled with strivingYeatclones and Opium-adjacent lackeys, he wasn’t satisfied to become another dead-eyed rage adherent “curating a vibe” out of chaos. Lunchbox’s counterproposal—confirmed by his 2024 album,Lunchtime.,and the singles and loosies on hisSoundCloud—relied not just on the characteristically blown-out sound of rage rap but the creativity of the melodies he put on top.\nLunchbox’s latest release,L.B. Cooper, is an exercise in refinement. Forsaking the trend of maximalist data dumps (each of his last three releases featured at least 22 songs), the tape comes in at a brisk 13 tracks and 25 minutes. Lunchbox stretches the limited space by turning the focus toward his off-kilter melodies, twisting his delivery as though he were rapping and singing under duress. Not every execution is outstanding, but the earnest effort to push himself—along with his team of producers—nets him more successes than missteps.\nTheL.B. Cooperproduction credits read like the Lunchbox All-Stars, with Amir, Chromes, and Mowz handling much of the responsibilities, as they did onNew JazzandLunchtime. They’ve all understood the assignment—robotic landscapes tinged with enough darkness to border on moody—though Amir still seems the most attuned to the rapper’s quirks, having worked with him since 2023. His frenetic synths on “Feelin Myself” hit top speed in an instant and seem almost to graft to Lunchbox’s voice. On “So Not Me,” a thundering bassline and a high, piercing whirr resemble the ambient noise on an intergalactic spaceship as Lunchbox tries to break through the gates of heaven with his croons.\nIt’s Chromes who scores the single strongest moment with “Goin Bad,” where melodies that sound ripped from the dial-up modems and thearcade gameDig Duglace the beat with boyish personality as Lunchbox spits with the unbridled energy of a Harlem street freestyle. Even new collaborators like Texas underground artist rexv2 fit seamlessly—his beat on “Act Like U Kno” wouldn’t feel out of place on the deep recesses ofF1lthy’shard drive, with synth progressions that ebb and flow with Lunchbox’s crescendos. But the relative uniformity means that less specular beats, like the ones on “Gta” and “Gta 2/Eta,” blend too easily into the background."

With the latest release fromBoldy James—The Bricktionary, a collaboration album with producerHarry Fraudand his third full-length album on DSPs of 2024—it’s hard not to think of the profession as a fitting analogy for the Detroit rapper. The oft-overlooked artist has remained a beacon of stability for street rap for more than a decade, showing up multiple times a year to weave morbid fairy tales with a deft touch. You can almost set your watch to Boldy’s tense ruminations about the perils of drug dealing and somber vignettes about consequences, or his preemptive “Where we at with it” and “227 ConCreatures” utterances, arriving at your doorstep once a quarter.\nA couple years ago, Boldy laid down a gauntlet for himself in an interview, saying, “I’m really just like one of the coolest kids in the schoolyard. So I don’t feel like I can ever oversaturate the market as long as it’s a quality product.”The Bricktionaryis a continuation of an astounding run of brilliance, ensuring that his claim remains uncontested. Arriving like a victory lap, the grandeur of Fraud’s production provides an intoxicating foil to Boldy’s steely honesty and delivery. Blanketed by manicured and ever-evolving loops, Boldy wields his blunt bars to take stock of his embattled ascension with immense clarity.\nBoldy has long treated his projects as full-length exercises with a singular producer. And whileThe Bricktionarydoesn’t reach the heights of his best collaborations—likePenalty of Leadership,his 2024 album withNicholas Craven, orThe Price of Tea in China,his 2020 opus withThe Alchemist—Fraud and Boldy’s chemistry is just as potent. Where Craven and Alchemist often craft arid production landscapes, Fraud’s tracks are markedly busier. An airy 1980s Brit-rock sample opens the floodgates on “Shadowboxing,” granting space to electric guitar shredding as Boldy makes offhandChappelle ShowandPolice Academyreferences. While “Speedy Gonzales” isn’t particularly dense, composition-wise, it’s engaging enough: The blistering drumbeat and elevated BPM make it feel like it should be in the background of a 4-star basketball recruit’s highlight tape. Fraud doesn’t reinvent the wheel—loop-based samples rule the land, stretching and extending through vocal chops, chord progressions, and swelling percussive movements—crafting a realm that feels natural for Boldy."

    "review_text": "In the late ’80s and early ’90s, embracing their heritage in the face of discrimination and economic struggle, South Asian diasporas around the globe experienced a cultural renaissance. In the UK, underground daytime raves and local radio stations rose out of the racial tensions of the ’70s and early ’80s, while South Asian returnees to East Africa sought to carve out new spaces following mass expulsions the previous decade. New clubs and festivals flourished in North America, and in the Caribbean, South Asians wove their own heritage into the islands’ diverse cultural fabric.\nSouth Asian musicians blended styles from across the region—Indian classical, Punjabi folk—with genres such as soca, hip-hop, and reggae, while also diving into the electronic sounds of jungle, house, and trip-hop that were sweeping dance floors globally. Melding the formal structures of Western dance genres with the elasticity of South Asian rhythms gave rise to a unique crop of idiosyncratic styles that feel as fresh and subversive today as they must have over 30 years ago. Yet most releases barely made a dent in the wider music scene at the time, and many artists ended their musical careers in obscurity.\nNaya Beat Volume 2: South Asian Dance And Electronic Music 1988​-​1994pulls together this fragmented history, connecting the intercontinental dots to reveal a shared moment when musicians from Kampala to Queens were blending new beat, acid house, and dub with South Asian sounds. One of the most remarkable things about this archival deep dive—which follows the equally enlighteningNaya Beat Vol 1, which focused on South Asian-infused Balearic, synth pop, and disco gems from the early ’80s—is that it doesn’t feel like a nostalgia trip. Instead, it’s packed with dancefloor bangers that still hit hard today, testifying to just how ahead of their time these artists were.\nKuljit Bhamra’s pounding proto-house track “Dholdrums,” with its dizzying tabla and dhol solos, wouldn’t feel out of place on aDaytimers compilation, and reveals a more experimental edge at a time when bhangra—a popular fusion of Punjabi pop with hip-hop and reggae—dominated the UK’s South Asian music scene. The Nairobi-born, Southall-based composer, producer, and musician Bhamra was himself an important player in the bhangra scene, producing thousands of songs for major artists such as Premi and even earning an MBE from Queen Elizabeth for his contributions to British Asian music.\nJust as fresh sounding is “Chamkay ‘D’ Chutney,” by Trinidad and Tobago’s self-proclaimed Princess of Soca, Sharlene Boodram. The track fuses ragga-inspired rhythms with the lively bounce of chutney soca, a genre that merges the melodic Indian influences of chutney (which emerged from the Indo-Caribbean community in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1940s) with the driving beat of soca. The enormous success of chutney music and Indo-Caribbean artists like Boodram highlights the important role of the Indo-Trinidadian population in shaping the islands’ national identity, especially during the 1990s, and reveals yet another facet of the kaleidoscopic nature of South Asian identity and sound. This version of “Chamkay ‘D’ Chutney” is remixed by Naya Beat label founders and compilation curators Raghav Mani (aka Ragz) and Filip Nikolic (aka Turbotito), who add a bass-heavy dancehall vibe replete with sitar samples and laser effects. It’s one of several updated tracks on the compilation; four out of 12 archival tracks appear in remixed form. Turbotito & Ragz also contribute a new original, “Pyaar,” a laid-back ode to dancehall and dub-infused bhangra, with vocals by the late bhangra vocalist Manjeet Kondal."

    "review_text": "Djrumlikes to switch things up. In his three-turntable DJ sets, the UK musician born Felix Manuel zigzags through genres, moods, and tempos, using atmospheric interludes and athletic turntablism to grease his audacious transitions. He’s so committed to unpredictability that sometimes he doesn’t even beatmatch in the conventional fashion—he just drops the track in, volume up, and sorts it out in the mix. It’s the opposite of seamless. (“A lot of the time, the seams are the interesting parts,” he toldResident Advisor.) In the studio, Manuel is equally loath to stay in one place for long. Even his early tracks, which hewed to a pensive, post-Burialbass-music template, felt more like suites, sidewinding through contrasting passages and patchwork beats; his recentremixofObjekt’s classic anthem “Ganzfeld” packs two extended ambient bookends and three different tempos into its 10-minute run.\nBut for a long time, the moody sweetness of Djrum’s productions gave a false impression, or at least a limited one: Record buyers who swooned to the ruminative, starry-eyed swirl of his recordings may not have been aware of the mad science he brings to the decks; clubbers who have witnessed him shredding the fabric of spacetime may not grasp the delicacy of his ear. Djrum’s new EPMeaning’s Edge, his first solo release in five years, feels like a reboot and a reintroduction, finally showing us a full picture of the artist. The EP’s five shapeshifting tracks detail a ruthless rhythmic focus, burning off the excess sentimentalism of his early work without abandoning the nuances of his music.\nThe nearly seven-minute “Codex” illustrates just how thoroughly he’s unified all aspects of his sound. The intricate drum programming, sticks dancing across snare rims and cymbal bells, nods to jazz, but the lurching cadences are drawn from decades of breakbeat science. IfPhotek’sModus Operandibrought Oppenheimer-level innovations to drum’n’bass, the mind-bending complexity of “Codex” feels like Manuel has just discovered cold fusion. Two competing basslines—one sub, one serrated—carry out a low-end pincer movement, roiling your insides and pinning you to the floor. There are echoes ofSquarepusherin the acidic antics of the midrange lead, but the track is doggedly dancefloor-oriented in a way that Tom Jenkinson has never been: The jagged-lightning riffs and seismic subs telegraph the lethal seriousness of a natural disaster. All that latent violence is balanced by a sumptuous smear of shakuhachi flute and Detroit-techno synth pads, and he sneakily weaves in innumerable other sounds under cover of the flash-bang drums—chimes, violin, even the briefest snippet of what sounds like clarinet—until the whole thing begins to resemble a bird’s nest outside a yarn factory, its brittle twigs dripping with color.\nIf “Codex” is intense, then “Crawl” is an alarm with no override switch. The 170-BPM groove’s staccato drum hits flicker like the wings of a mechanical hummingbird, the barrage coming at you from every conceivable angle. I can’t think of the last time I heard more dynamic use of the stereo field. The rush of drums can be thrilling, like a hailstorm, and soothing, like a waterfall. But it’s also unsettling: Pockets of reverb expand and contract without warning, yanking you from a dank cavern to an anechoic chamber and back again in milliseconds. The irreality of the soundstage only heightens the fight-or-flight response triggered by the drums’ rapid-fire juggernaut, leaving you on edge. Structurally, this feels like something new for Djrum: In place of his habitual feints and hard lefts, “Crawl” simply rolls without end, like swells on the high sea, sometimes bassier and sometimes treblier, but essentially unchanged; it seems like it could go on like that forever, a perpetual motion machine running on nerves."

    "review_text": "If we’re lucky to live long enough, we make beautiful memories that warp and splinter and, eventually, fade away completely.Merope, the Lithuanian-Belgian experimental folk project led by multi-instrumentalists Indrė Jurgelevičiūtė and Bert Cools, taps into that lovely devastation onV​ė​jula. The duo approaches each sound with reverent curiosity, arranging their songs with the care of someone designing a shadowbox. Each sample loop, synth gurgle, and vocal snippet sits just so, sparkling when the light catches and gently fading like late afternoon sun. It’s a softly commanding record, not building a world as much as revealing one. There is always much to notice, but it’s nearly impossible to take it all in at once.\nV​ė​julais Merope’s fifth album, but first to fully embrace their diaphanous, New Age-y inclinations. The band began as an EU-spanning “alternative world music” quintet, using acoustic instruments, light processing effects, and soft jazz flourishes to conjure gentle pastoral groovers. Merope whittled to a trio for 2018’snakt​ė​sand 2021’sSalos, reinterpreting Lithuanian folk songs with heavier use of electronics and, in the case ofSalos, a 24-person chamber choir. Jurgelevičiūtė and Cools madeV​ė​julaas a duo, but invited collaborators likeShahzad Ismaily,Laraaji, andBill Frisellinto the fold. Speaking tothe Bozar Centre for Fine Artsin Brussels, Cools described the process behindV​ė​julaas an exercise in presence. “You never know when you’re going to find a song. It could be in something very small,” he explained. “It’s magic.”\nThe building blocks of any Merope composition are Jurgelevičiūtė’s vocals and kanklės, a zither-like Lithuanian stringed instrument whose sonorous shimmer was traditionally associated with protection from death and evil spirits. Here, Jurgelevičiūtė and Cools seem more interested in the textural possibilities than the classical folk context. Both elements get their own, unadorned moments in the spotlight—Jurgelevičiūtė’s mournful melodies on “Lopšinė” (Lithuanian for “lullaby”), the radiant rippling of the kanklės-only “Vija”—but more often, they’re spliced into tesserae and organized into glittering mosaics. On “Aglala,” filtered microsamples of Jurgelevičiūtė’s voice tumble over each other before plunging beneath a thick synth drone, occasionally bobbing to the surface for air. Kanklės samples flicker in the background of “Spindulė,” wavering in and out of focus like scraps of overheard conversation. The recontextualization is inspired, threading the old world to the new without losing any mysticism in the process.\nThough it’s tempting to brandV​ė​jula’s elegant drift as ambient music, it’s a disservice to how these songs twist and expand.V​ė​julanever feels meant to rest in the background; there’s too much movement, and the arrangements are too restless to sustain a zen state. It’s easy to get lost inside these tunes, though. “Namopi,” which prominently features Laraaji’s zither, slowly builds into a glimmering cascade of sound. When, after about three minutes, the elements all briefly drop out, it’s like the first stoplight after a long drive. Each piece onV​ė​julaoffers a chance at transcendence, even if only for a small moment. Even the quickest glimpses into the beyond are revelatory. It’s heavy work, but always welcome and necessary."

    "review_text": "Population IItick all the boxes for a proper prog-rock act. They can easilyfill an entire album sidewith a single track. Their drummer is also their lead singer. The guitarist and bassistdouble as synth players. And they hail from Quebec, historicallythe proggiestof all Canadian provinces. But approached from a different vantage, the Montreal trio is also a prototypical garage-rock band, fueled by maniacal energy, blistering fuzz, and a belief in raw power over precision. Their collision of prog excess and punk attitude made them a perfect fit forJohn Dwyer’s Castle Face label, which released Population II’s first proper album,À la Ô Terre, in 2020. But likeTy SegallandKing Gizzard & the Lizard Wizardbefore them, Population II used their early Castle Face connection as a springboard to launch themselves on their own unpredictable trajectory.\nWith their third album,Maintenant Jamais, Population II confront an existential quandary: Are you still a prog band if all your songs are under five minutes? “We tried to make our songs catchier,” drummer-vocalist Pierre-Luc Grattonrecently admittedto Montreal’sLe Devoir. “For this album, we wondered how to play these strange notes without sounding like we spend our lives on Quebec-prog discussion forums.” But where ’70s forebears likePink FloydandRushshrewdly compartmentalized their multi-sectional suites and radio-friendly singles, Population II delight in blurring the line between artful ambition and untamed abandon. Produced withMarie Davidsonassociate Dominic Vanchesteing,Maintenant Jamaisforegrounds sharper melodies, lusher textures, and tighter grooves, but retains the fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants philosophy that guided the band’s previous voyages to the heart of the sun.\nFor Population II, a pop hook is just that: a sharp implement they can use to drag you wherever they want to go. Where Gratton once had to wail wildly over his band’s interstellar overdrive,Maintenant Jamaissees him comfortably settle into theLennon-esque elocution favored by the likes of post-ManipulatorTy Segalland pre-CurrentsKevin Parker. (The lysergic riffs and cascading momentum of “homme étoilé” provide a particularly potent flashback of a time whenTame Impalawere essentially aDungentribute act.) But Population II aren’t as interested in crafting pop songs as building Trojan horses: The breathy melody and coolVirgin Suicidesatmosphere of “Prévisions” lure you unsuspectingly into a stormy psychedelic squall courtesy of guitarist Tristan Lacombe, while “Mariano (Jamais je ne t’oublierai)” counters its hip-shaking synth-funk beat with skull-splitting blasts of wah-wah and keyboard drone that overtake the song like a white splotch devouring a melting film strip."

    "review_text": "So Wavy Luciano, the latest mixtape by Bloody!, pushes hedonism to manic-depressive extremes. One moment, the New York City rapper sounds utterly unbothered, recalling stoned hookups and late-night cups of coffee over pillowy plugg beats; the next, he raps like he’s shaking you by the shoulders, so bored he’s beginning to panic. On “Need a Nerdy Bitch,” fantasizing about the bookish girl of his dreams sends Bloody! spiraling, stray bytes of cyborgian Auto-Tune flying off each bar like spittle as his rant grows more impassioned. “Man, I need me a quiet bitch,” he half-sings, half-pants to the tune ofJugg6k’s StoopidXool-esque synth pads, beginning to outpace the beat. “Man, I need some Xans. Man, I need a plan. Man, I need some love,” he continues, wrung out in the gears of a sinister desiring-machine. Though the phrase “I feel good” is something of a mantra throughout the tape, it’s repeated with a sense of superstitious habit. Bloody! knows pleasure is fleeting, and he’s hanging on for dear life.\nBloody! rose to underground prominence in the early 2020s as part of an emerging wave of jerk-rap revivalists likeXaviersobased,idkcap, andpercosits, who experimented with snare-centric drum programming and lo-fi sound design. His 2022SUPER JAIL!!!mixtape was one of the scene’s most ethereal releases. While his peers often opted to bury their voices beneath layers of pixelation, Bloody! favored clarity, fostering an unusually meditative energy despite his liberal use of distortion. As he and most of the nu-jerk originators have pursued other genres, Bloody!’s ambient approach to swag rap has remained constant. Citing artists like Chicago drill rapperLil Jay, former Soulja Boy signeeAgoff, and pre-mixtapeCartias influences, his recent work embraces the D.I.Y. aesthetic of the early 2010s online underground, particularly the raw, trebly interplay between low-bitrate instrumentals and deadpan vocals recorded straight to laptop via Snowball mic.\nBloody!’s affinity for early Soundcloud rap is especially evident onSo Wavy Luciano. Plugg production is more influential than ever in the alt-rap ecosystem, but offshoots likepluggnbanddark pluggtend to abandon its breathable simplicity to craft intricate compositions.So Wavy Lucianois traditionalist by comparison. Aside from decorative bells and the occasional wriggling sine wave, its production de-emphasizes melody in favor of moody organ chords that sprawl out over several bars.\nThe spaciousness allows Bloody! to explore off-kilter pockets and deliveries with the curiosity of a jazz improviser. Midway through “You Know Its Luciano,” he jabs at the beat with slight variations of the song’s title, letting ripples of delay and heavy reverb emanate from his voice and intersect within the chord progression. It’s a welcome moment of tranquility carved out between verses about stick talk and pill-popping. On “I Feel Good,” Bloody! hops on an instrumental that sounds like a cutesy JRPG overworld theme, indexing his favorite things like he’sJulie Andrews inThe Sound of Music. Using the list as a generative device allows him to again direct the listener’s attention to his cadence rather than lyricism. As the track continues for nearly four minutes, Bloody! gets increasingly lost in the reverie, howling and stretching out his syllables as he remarks that the weed he smokes “smells so goooooood.”\nEventually, though, cracks start to form in the dopaminergic feedback loop: “When I’m away from you, I don’t feel good,” he later admits, before numbing the pain with a Xanax. Even in his state of ecstasy, Bloody! reveals a paranoid self-awareness: a rough comedown looms in the shadows. For the moment, though,So Wavy Lucianois a pleasantly dreamy space to curl up inside. As droning keys echo into oblivion, spinning the album feels like getting so drowsy that each thought seems to trail off mid-sentence. With memory and reason beyond your grasp, there’s no place to occupy but the present, buoyed by a muffled 808 kick."

    "review_text": "There’s a moment on “bluffing in the snow,” the first track onAndré 3000’s new surprise-released solo piano EP, where you can hear the artist thinking. For roughly the first half of the three-minute piece, he tries out different ideas—a rigid eighth-note rhythm; a billowy chord progression—without committing to any one direction. Then, around the 1:25 mark, he hits on a head-nodding pattern, with low and high registers standing in for kick drum and snare. He keeps floating away from the motif and then returning, refining it a little more each time, until it becomes a hypnotic staccato groove.\nMake no mistake, this passage isn’t supplanting the “shake it like a Polaroid picture” breakdown in the 3 Stacks canon anytime soon. But there’s an intimate thrill in eavesdropping on that real-time creative decision. IfThe Love Belowwas a finished masterpiece, this latest offering isn’t just, as the title suggests, a peek inside the sketchbook—it’s an in-the-moment look at the pencil moving across the page.\nIt’s also the latest step in the larger conceptual artwork that is André 3000’s shift from hitmaking rapper-songwriter-producer to beatific Johnny Appleseed of vibe. It’s been around six years since he made flutespotting a national pastime. (Journalist Antonia Cereijido’sviral 2019 tweet, documenting her disbelief at seeing the Outkast icon playing his woodwind while strolling through LAX, now seems like a heartwarming relic of a simpler time.) Those sightings culminated inNew Blue Sun, the master wordsmith’s famously bar-less 2023 solo debut, and a record that seemed to crystallize our era’s new New Age aesthetic in a sonic mood board whereAlice Coltraneshares space with Erewhon.\nThis all could have turned out to be just a phase, a sojourn into process-over-product abstraction before André returned to the vibrant lyrical murals that defined a generation. But as the lengthy, surprisingly rewardingNew Blue Suntour showed, he made a real commitment to instrumental, improvisational music, approached with a determinedly amateur spirit.\nThat commitment is even clearer on7 piano sketches.New Blue Sunwas, after all, a studio creation, honed with the help of a crew of skilled collaborators. This is a literal iPhone dump, a collection of mostly verité documents—captured, as the artistrevealed on Instagram, nearly a decade beforeNew Blue Sun—of André sitting down at the keys and letting his fingers wander, in his words, “randomly but with purpose.” The sound is appealingly grainy; the rough edges, such as occasional mic fluff, or what sounds like faint background chatter, proudly left in."

    "review_text": "For almost a decade now,Obongjayar’s chameleonic voice has offered words of self-love, survival, and seduction. When he steps an octave up from his resting pitch, the Nigerian-born, London-based singer embodies a vengeful ghost with unfinished business; an octave down, and he transforms into a ferocious dancehall MC. “This place is ugly,” Obongjayar sang on “God’s Own Children,” a modern spiritual from 2020’sWhich Way Is Forward?EP. “Don’t let it rob you/Of your face, of your grace, and of your body.”\n“Born in This Body,” from his new album,Paradise Now, calls back to that sentiment: “You’re covered in paint/Your clothes and your shoes don’t fit/Don’t make yourself small/For no one.” Except this body’s got five more years of disillusionment caked under its nails, and the mood of the moment is far closer to the one Obongjayar captures on opening track “It’s Time.” “I walk the world with my head on a swivel,” he quivers in his upper register, “It’s hard trusting anything.”Paradise Nowis twitchy and anxious, stuffed with ruminations on love, belonging, and violence. Obongjayar worked on the record with proven hitmakers behindDoja CatandKendrick Lamar, and as it races through alt-R&B, Afro-dance rhythms, indie rock, and brooding Americana, a globalized, omnivorous popstar emerges. He’s instinctive but legible, algorithmically tuned without being dull, political right up to the line of provocation. Most importantly, he can make you move.\nThe first four songs onParadise Nowconstitute their own mini-arc, tracing a relationship as it goes sour. Obongjayar delivers the scornful “Life Ahead” through gritted teeth, but an overwrought arrangement of martial drums, marimba, and gunshot samples can’t match the precision aim of his jabs. More successful is “Peace in Your Heart,” which situates itself in an indie-pop niche betweenthe xx’sself-titledandBraids’Native Speaker. Things don’t really get going, though, until the album has cleared its throat of trite breakup drama altogether. On “Jellyfish,” Obongjayar rails against “spineless” lawmakers in the UK and stateside (“Bomb bomb spawned by the stars and stripes”) alike. Though he writes in broad strokes—no “Fuck Badenoch”’s to be found here—the shuddering, corkscrewing synthesizer leaves his message unmistakable: Things are going down the drain. Fast. “Talk Olympics,” featuringLittle Simz, ratchets up the tempo even further, making percussive instruments out of both artists in a slightly more hospitable take onTanzaniansingeli.\nObongjayar then breezes past some tender Afropop (“Prayer”) and glassy soul indebted toBlondeandMoses Sumney(“Moon Eyes”) before suddenly arriving at what sounds like the gates of hell itself. “Baby ride me like a cowboy/I’m your cowboy,” he croons on “Sweet Danger,” toying with the inherent machismo of the American West while the song’s blistered blues threaten to clamp their jaws around him. “There’s no saving me.” If salvation is out of reach, one may as well dance among the flames. The best song onParadise Nowis far and away “Not in Surrender,” a disco punk anthem that opens with the triumphant misdirect, “I put my hands up, not in surrender/I’m getting ready to fly.” Amidst white-hotDFAcowbells, Obongjayar grooves likeOff the Wall-eraMJand seethes likeTV on the Radio’sTunde Adebimpe, another musician whose best work blurs the boundaries between fucking upthesystemand justplainfucking."

    "review_text": "World-building comes naturally to Yana Kedrina. AsKedr Livanskiy, the Moscow singer-producer has released three albums of dark, evocative electro pop rooted in a diverse spread of electronic influences: techno, IDM, garage, ambient, and more. With her ever-changing sound, Kedrina has carved out a distinct lane for herself: an artist less beholden to explicit formalism or realism than, in her own words, the “transformation, deconstruction, and the escapism” of it all. It’s no surprise thatMyrtus Myth, her fourth LP, once again represents a departure from her previous work. What is surprising, though, is the album’s general sense of restraint, even tameness, shelving Kedrina’s signature club thump for dream pop that’s both well done and well-worn.\nThis is Kedrina’s most extensive collaboration as a solo artist withFlaty; while the Gost Zvuk-affiliated producer has written and produced for her last two albums, this time around he co-wrote and produced Kedrina’s entire record.Myrtus Mythis operatic in tone and scope, exploring grief and hopelessness as Kedrina’s soaring vocals take us through epic scenes of beasts, angels, and the cosmos. The album embraces the idea of mythological narrative as a throughline of the human condition, exploring loss through references to stories like that of Orpheus and Eurydice and the Hindu concept of Kali Yuga (the dark age before the end of the world). Regarding the album’s subject matter, Kedrina has noted that “the last couple of years have been incredibly difficult for many people on earth”; if a more universal message is the goal, maybe it makes sense forMyrtus Mythto show us Kedrina at her most accessible.\nAccessible can be a good thing, especially the way Kedrina flips it. While we’ve previously heard her craft some of her catchiest hooks over woozy house grooves, like on 2019’s “Sky Kisses,”Myrtus Mythgives us some good old-fashioned, hot-off-the-airwaves capital-P Pop. On her last solo album,Liminal Soul, Kedrina teased her straightforward pop chops on “Boy”; here, she leans more fully into ’70s- and ’80s-inspired songwriting, most notably on singles “Anna” and “Spades on Hearts.” “Agata Dreams” is tinged with a littleEverything But the Girluntil the beat really starts chattering. With a stronger emphasis on live instruments, these tracks come to life in a surprisingly commanding manner, suggesting a captivating stage presence rather than an infectious dancefloor buzz.\nWhereMyrtus Mythexcels is when Kedrina accesses the softness of dream pop within her usual electronic experiments. On the subtly jungle-influenced “Night Trains,” what might be the world’s gentlest breakbeat skitters steadily under churchlike synths and a wispy vocal refrain: “Leave on familiar trains, leaving cities.” It feels both minimal and rich, capturing the skill and assuredness in the development of her craft and style. On the flipside, “Zver” embraces a more maximal sound than before; throughout a dirgelike take on a jangle-pop melody, misty strings, brass, and vocals echo, swell, and swirl into one another like smoke. Kedrina has previously mastered playing outside the bounds of genre convention, and to hear her experimenting within them brings a new and welcome dimension to her abilities as a songwriter and producer."

    "review_text": "“What we need is more silly men,” declaresFrank Blackon “Two Reelers,” a salute to the Three Stooges that arrives about halfway throughTeenager of the Year, the second album the former Black Francis released after disbanding thePixiesin 1993. His celebration of the idiocy of Larry, Curly, and Moe makes for an unusual statement of purpose—a rallying call for alt-rockers to embrace the freedom of being ridiculous.\nSilliness was in scarce supply when Black releasedTeenager of the Yearin May of 1994. Three years afterNirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” shot its way into the Hot 100, the alternative rock explosion of the ’90s had acquired a decidedly dour aura, one cultivated by legions of lumbering grunge bands and tortured industrial outfits. The Pixies’ artful nightmares may have softened the ground for the angst-ridden acts jostling for position on MTV’s120 Minutes, but Black purposefully separated himself from the pack once he launched his solo career. He didn’t hang with the flannel-clad hipsters; he aligned himself with the defiantly geekyThey Might Be Giants, the Brooklyn-based college-rock duo he called his “favorite band” during the promotional push forTeenager of the Year—a cycle that included a jaunt opening for TMBG in the fall of ’94.\nThe fact that he twice took an opening slot for an established act in ’94—in the spring, he went out with theRamones—could be seen as evidence of Black’s diminishing status within alt-rock circles, butTeenager of the Yearsuggests that he took deliberately took himself out of the rat race. Teeming with tales of underwater empires and Los Angeles history lessons, the album exists in its own universe, a testament to Black’s wide and varied cultural obsessions. It’s also an album that could only have been made in the mid-’90s, when the CD boom poured enough cash into the music industry for a cult rocker like Black to ensconce himself in posh L.A. studios and indulge his every whim, resulting in an album as lengthy as a double LP—indeed, the only physical edition of the 30th Anniversary reissue is a gold double-vinyl—but not structured like the carefully sculpted gatefold classics of yore. Instead, its contours feel dictated strictly by the capacity of a compact disc: It sprawls until it suddenly stops, not because it reached its destination but because it ran out of road.\nBlack scattered sharp, carefully sculpted songs throughout the album. One of them, a buoyant piece of power pop called “Headache,” actually did make headway in the alt-rock mainstream; it spent 11 weeks onBillboard’s Modern Rock charts, a run that was longer than either “Los Angeles” or “Hang Onto Your Ego,” the two singles pulled from his eponymous 1993 solo debut. Those punchy numbers are balanced by excursions into dreamy romanticism (“Speedy Marie,” “I Could Stay Here Forever”), invented Western epics (“Calistan”), and suites shrunken to dioramas (“Freedom Rock,” “Olé Mulholland”). Each of these longer pieces serves as guideposts in a record that offers a series of left turns as it swerves from revved-up rockabilly to smooth lovers rock, with Black only occasionally attempting to mitigate the whiplash change of moods. He’s too wrapped up in following his counterintuitive muse to consider pandering to passive listeners."

The affected appreciation for small-time British indie darlings; the androgynous mop-top haircuts and ratty cardigans; the C86 tapes passed between friends; fanzines named after ’60s B-movies likeTeenage Gang Debs; record labels called Factory and Caroline and Sarah. All the late nights spent painstakingly cutting and pasting artwork for mixtapes, discussing rare vinyl pressings from Japan and all-female garage-rock bands from the ’60s—those were hours ostensibly spent praying at the altar of something that would become known as “indie rock,” sure, but let’s face it. Every out-of-print 7\" and faded band shirt, every copy ofNMEandMelody Maker, every hour spent glued to the radio to tape your favorite band’s latest song—they were all in service of the hope that one late night, delirious from the high of subcultural communion, you might just get the chance towalk your crush home.\nUnrestintuitively grasped the latent lust in musical obsession: They named one of theirearliest songsafterLady Chatterley’s Lover; theirfirst albumopened with a cover ofthe Byrds’ “So You Want to Be a Rock’n’Roll Star” and included an insert that read “YOU ONLY LOVE ONCE!” Mark Robinson was still a high-school student in Arlington, Virginia, when he formed Unrest with drummer Phil Krauth in 1984—many of his first albums used old Wakefield High School yearbook photos for their artwork. He founded a label that he called Teen-Beat, which became a sprawling archive of his work with Unrest: thestation wagonthey used on their first tours,a party they threwto decorate the covers of their first LP. Being in a band, the Teen-Beat catalog seemed to suggest, was as much about what happened offstage as what made its way to tape.\nUnrest’s early albums careened from guttural punk to jangly,Smiths-indebted pop, driven by an improvisational approach and the directive to never play the same song twice. Though they clearly borrowed from the frenetic attack of Dischord bands likeMinor Threatand Embrace, Unrest’s distinctly romantic leanings and general levity felt worlds apart from the self-serious hardcore scene happening in nearby Washington, D.C. They often seemed more in step with the twee sounds of the Pacific Northwest, but even then, they dared to consummate the longings that the K Records roster so often left implied: “I said I want tofuck youall the time,” Robinson sang on “Yes, She Is My Skinhead Girl.”"

    "review_text": "How do you pin down a band like Broncho? Since its 2011 debut, the Oklahoma quartet served up cheeky, cocksure albums of indie rock, throughout which frontman Ryan Lindsey aimed to goad us into fighting, fucking, and raising hell. It landed the band spots in HBO’sGirls, a Cartoon Network joint, and even a Fabletics commercial. Though their sound was eclectic and ever-evolving, Broncho always maintained their moxie. But the last we’d gotten of that Broncho attitude (as a full album, anyway) was more than six years ago—and a lot can change in six years, as evidenced on their fifth LP,Natural Pleasure. Broncho’s mellowed out; the band’s memories of life, love, and pain sound woozier, gentler. But even amidNatural Pleasure’s introspective haze, the band’s signature playfulness still remains in clear view.\nThroughoutNatural Pleasure, the spaciness of Broncho’s garage-rock grit thickens into something rounder, lusher—it’s chiller than ever. The first two songs, “Imagination” and “Funny,” kick off the album with rich guitar and echoing, blissed-out vocals. The album’s overall attitude is more assured; here, Broncho expresses subtler emotions with a breezy poise. “Cool” replaces the glib flirtation of older songs like “Class Historian” with a coy trip-hop horniness, as metallic drums andMezzanine-esque bass roil beneath Penny Pitchlynn’s breathy crooning. And “You Got Me” is a slow, surprisingly tender ode from Lindsey to his two children, in which he expresses his care with a sense of humor: “Safe drivin’, don’t die.” There’s not much drama in these lyrics: no moreTaj Mahals, no femme fatales spilling blood downHarry Hines Boulevard. Instead, the album zeroes in on little vignettes and everyday reflections, with stripped-down lyrics that bring each emotion into focus.\nNatural Pleasureisn’t all business, mind you. Broncho’s first proper dance-along anthem, “Get Gone,” marries atmospheric vocals with new wave-y synths and a thumping four-on-the-floor drumbeat. Even on “Original Guilt,” which delves into heavier subject matter, Lindsey’s avowal that “nobody’s evil” is followed up with the goofy statement that “nobody here is totally Knievel.” These songs don’t show Broncho totally forgoing depth; instead, they acknowledge that there’s sincere feeling to be mined, Rorschach-style, from even the most unserious of statements.\nThis pervading haze is double-edged, though, as the album admittedly gets a little repetitive once the more upbeat tracks give way to a slower second half. It’s a gorgeous listen, but the line between mesmerizing and soporific starts to blur as the songs’ edges melt into one another, kind of like how couchlock can feel amazing until you realize you haven’t gotten up in hours. Here, Broncho’s writing is as evocative as it’s ever been. The textures are justdecadent. But the album’s strongest tracks are its most upbeat, which—givenNatural Pleasure’s pacing and tone—means the record suffers from an early peak and a drawn-out comedown. Thankfully, the country-tinged lilt of “Dreamin’” adds sharpness to the album’s conclusion, like a soothing wake-up call."

    "review_text": "IfLambrini Girls’ debut album,Who Let the Dogs Out,had come out a decade ago, many of its lyrics could have prompted dozens of millennial pink mugs: “Cold resting bitch face,” “Don’t tell me to calm down,” and “Getting used to saying no.” But the Brighton punk duo’s cheeky rants aren’t just fodder for an entry-level, marketable notion of anger-as-empowerment. In the past, you were advised to turn up the gas on your inner flame in the name of self-respect, to awaken you from the patriarchy’s obedient slumber. But Lambrini Girls take things one step further, knowing that if you let that fire blaze, you’ve gotta funnel that anger into something fun—or risk all-consuming misery. Everyday folks might channel those feelings into the cursory axe throwing class or birthday trip to a demolition room. For singer-guitarist Phoebe Lunny and bassist Lilly Macieira, it means railing against misogyny, homophobia, and the upper class with 30 minutes of fast-and-loose party punk.\nLambrini Girls introduced themselves to the world in 2022 with scathing sarcasm,feigning, “Help me, I’m gay/Yet everything I do is for the male gaze.” In other words: They’re here, they’re queer, and they don’t take themselves too seriously—unlike some of theirself-righteouspunk neighbors. ThroughoutWho Let the Dogs Out, Lambrini Girls strive to maintain autonomy in a corrupt industry and capitalist country without sacrificing their right to a good time, playing like they have a guitar in one hand and a sloshing pint in the other. Take “No Homo” or “Filthy Rich Nepo Baby,” where they indulge in immediate riffs and the type of semi-sloppy guitar solo that makes the bar go wild. It’s easy to trace the rebellious tone of the artists they were drawn to as kids (Kathleen Hanna, Joan Jett, Courtney Love) and the scruffy grunge of sneering bands they admired later on (the Jesus Lizard, Shellac, Nirvana). But the amalgamation of those influences is deliriously rambunctious in practice. For Lambrini Girls, the best part of surrendering to your anger is the joy of telling someone off. Catch the band live and that much is impossible to misinterpret, between the jubilant crowd interactions and alcohol-fueled giggling and shrugging.\nRecorded withGilla Bandbassist Daniel Fox,Who Let the Dogs Outwisely leans on nosier elements when the subject matter gets earnest. Opener “Bad Apple,” a searing takedown of police corruption, cues up a rapidfire BPM, blown-out bass, and caffeinated guitar shredding that lends heft to a serious topic; the track wasspurredby the 2021 murder of Sarah Everard by a Metropolitan Police officer, and took years to formulate with the correct tone. Lunny and Macieira use “Nothing Tastes as Good as It Feels” to confront theirown experienceswith eating disorders, paraphrasing Kate Moss’ infamous (andsince retracted) quote and blaming the industry Moss once represented for their anorexia-induced missed periods. Lambrini Girls almost becomethe Vinesreincarnated in the process, fusing power-pop structure with fuzzy alt-rock to replicate the disorder’s seductively poisonous appeal. When the song spirals out of control by the end, Lunny spits out a proper good riddance: “Diet drinks taste like absolute fucking shit/Give me full fat, you fucking bastards.”"

    "review_text": "From the beginning,Richie Hawtinwas drawn to extremes. He called his label Plus 8, a reference to the upper limit of a Technics 1200’s pitch fader. Still, the techno upstart seemed doubtful as to which pole he gravitated toward: speed or stealth? Balls-to-the-wall aggression or careful restraint? On his earliest singles, Hawtin planted his flag in pounding rave mayhem. A UK native who had grown up in Windsor, Ontario, a stone’s throw from the Motor City, he tossed down the gauntlet on tracks like 1990’s “Technarchy,” determined to out-hardcore Detroit techno’s pioneers at their most bruising. But on his first two albums, released within mere months of each other in 1993, ambivalence took hold, and he shuttled between apocalyptic bunker busters like “F.U.” and “Smak” and sweeter, more contemplative tracks like “A New Day” and “Plasticine.”\nOn 1994’sMusik—recently reissued in celebration of its 30th anniversary; the vinyl has been remastered from the original tapes—Hawtin finally chose sides. The shaven-headed DJ was rapidly becoming famous for the parties he was throwing around the Detroit area, covering crumbling warehouses in black plastic and bringing in enough sound to make the floors shake. But unlike those overwhelmingly physical experiences, the introvertedMusikwas geared toward the mind, reconfiguring acid house’s familiar contours according to new specifications: spare, trippy, and, often, disorientingly slow.\nHawtin had already laid the groundwork for this new sound with Plastikman’s 1993 albumSheet One, turning the undulating waveforms of the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer into something graceful and liquid—a far cry from the guttural squelch with which it had been associated since Phuture’s 1987 ur-anthem, “Acid Tracks.” OnMusik, Hawtin continued to find new ways to make the 303 sing, using its trademark quirks to generate uncannily expressive tones that resembled the keening of forlorn cyborgs.\nAfter an introductory stretch that resembles the eerie moan of whale song—a fittingly new-age reference for an album aimed at the intersection of ambient and techno—“Konception” introduces us to Hawtin’s trademark acid line by way of a sort of opening soliloquy: a four-note sequence that slips and rolls like beads of quicksilver before disintegrating into dub delay. It’s a simple up-and-down riff, but the 303’s filter, which works by masking or revealing the frequencies inherent in any given tone, gives it a strange, mysterious shape, as though it were vibrating in midair, appearing and disappearing at the same time, translucent and unstable. The riff would be monotonous if it were not constantly in motion, morphing subtly, sometimes imperceptibly, with every bar. Every other element in the track—stolid kick drum, syncopated woodblocks, tension-stoking claps—feels intended to frame and highlight the acid line’s ephemeral outline."

    "review_text": "On their long-awaited reunion record,Mcluskydon’t assume the role of serious elder statesmen of punk—and thank God for that. They’ve sidestepped the indignity that often comes with gettin’ the band back together, mostly because Mclusky understand better than anyone that dignity is overrated. Onthe world is still here and so are we,there’s no grandstanding, no illusion of self-respect, no demand to be taken seriously, because none of that was ever Mclusky’s goal to begin with.\nthe world is still hereis the Welsh band’s first new record since 2004’sThe Difference Between Me and You Is That I’m Not on Fireand far and away their most invigorating since the Steve Albini-produced classicMcLusky Do Dallas. It’s not merely a return to their old ways, nor does theirlong-teasedreunion feel like a cynical, nostalgia-fueled cash grab. Instead, the record is a series of reminders of what Mclusky are still capable of—whether that’s melting faces in under a minute with “juan party-system” or the razor’s-edge guitar hammering driving “the digger you deep.”the world is still herebrings the band’s signature early-’00s vulgarity into our post-Brexit, Trump-dominated moment, bearing traces of singer and guitarist Andrew “Falco” Falkous’ other band,Future of the Left, in balancing full-throated (but not heavy-handed) political call-outs with a characteristic indifference to respectability or piousness.\nTake the slow-chugging “people person,” which rides its refrain—“lotta people lotta people lotta people”—to a callout of the milquetoast moderates who stay silent in the face of injustice and later claim they were always on the right side of history. It’s hard to hear the song’s final lines and not think of self-professed “progressives,” for example, who continue to ignore or excuse the ongoing genocide of Palestinians: “Exploding kids, exploding kids, exploding kids can kill the mood/Can kill the mood if kid explosions aren’t your heart’s desire … A lot of people like to be wise after the event.”\nIt’s tough to picture an American equivalent of Mclusky; you need a lived-in hatred of the crown and a specifically British flavor of crassness to make music that sounds like their 2001 track “Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues” or its 2020s counterpart, “the unpopular parts of a pig.” The latter reignites the clobbering shred of its predecessor and matches the speed and irreverence of its motormouthing, as Falkous sings, “Delicate seeds come from delicate flowers/that was the horseshit she fed me for hours.” Mclusky aren’t a well-oiled machine so much as a demolition derby-ready junker that’s banged up to all hell but can still withstand plenty of battering. Falkous’ uncannily versatile voice is in command throughout it all, as he growls about “money makers makin’ mooooooooooves” like a rabid dog on “cops and coppers,” stretches the vowel sounds in “the competent horse thief” in a way that toes the line between brilliance and insufferability, and patters, “Tell me you’re Banksy without being Banksy” beforescromitingthe bridge of “kafka-esque novelist franz kafka.”"

    "review_text": "In the mid-1990s, Jon Tye was relentlessly focused on electronic music’s most extreme possibilities. That was the title of theinaugural compilationfrom his label, Lo Recordings, which aimed to map the fringes of post-rave electronic music in category-smashing experiments from artists likeScanner,Omni Trio, andLuke Vibert’sWagon Christproject. Lo Recordings spent the next few years pushing outward, breaking down distinctions between genres and modes of listening on comps likeUnited MutationsandFurther Mutations, enlisting a provocatively motley crew—Aphex Twin,Tortoise,Hood,Thurston Moore,Squarepusher,Stereolab—in their demolition work.\nMost extreme of all was the music Tye released under his ownTwisted Sciencealias, by turns erratic and overdriven or dusty and dissonant. But he also had other, mellower projects, and as time has gone by, the dulcet side of his music has come to the fore. In 2021, the ambient historians at Music From Memory curated astar-gazing selectionof the ambient and ambient techno he produced in the early 1990s in MLO, a duo with fellow Brit Peter Smith; now the label turns its attention to his ambient project Ocean Moon.Ways to the Deep Meadow’s seven atmospheric tracks are all new productions, but their billowing pads, gently pulsing arpeggios, and general air of wide-eyed wonder sound so classic, it would be easy to mistake the album for an archival release.\nThe mood throughout bobs somewhere between tranquil and hypnotic, beginning with the prayer bowl and rainfall that open “Ways to the Deep Meadow.” That song—inspired by a poem by Angus MacLise, who played inthe Velvet UndergroundandLa Monte Young’s Theatre of Eternal Music before moving to Nepal—is led by gently cycling synth arpeggios whose curious rises and falls remind me of one of M.C. Escher’s staircases. “Souls Fall Away” is a buoyant froth of beatific, if indecipherable, vocals, and “Angel Falls,” a few tracks later, evokes similar heavenliness. Things really only come down to earth twice: “Day of the Voyage” is a blissed-out procession led by a halting electronic drum pattern evocative of Indian music; “Plains of Paradise” is a Balearic devotional driven by rippling congas.\nPer label press materials, portions of the album were apparently inspired by artificial intelligence, as Tye sought alternatives—theoretical, philosophical, and even spiritual—to what he saw as more pessimistic or critical perspectives. It’s unclear, however, whether he actually used A.I. tools in generating or organizing his sounds, or simply took inspiration, like any science-fiction writer, from the idea of the technology. In the angelic choirs and electronic pulses of “Ways to the Deep Meadow,” it’s certainly possible to perceive a sense of optimism about technology, and press materials say thatHolly Herndon’s Holly+ app was used to process text from Janine Rook’sMade in Dreams, the exhibition that Ocean Moon’s song of the same name was created to soundtrack. But no words are detectable in that song, and fortunately nothing onWays to the Deep Meadowbears traces of low-fidelity artifacts or other telltale marks of A.I. slop."

    "review_text": "If you recognize Joumana Kayrouz, there’s a good chance you once owned a Michigan driver’s license. A prolific billboard siren, the 60-year-oldaccident attorneyturnedlocal celebritydons black leather and flashes a steely gaze beneath platinum blonde hair in roadside ads welcoming weary bands home to the Detroit metro radius.Prostitutesinger Moe readily admits he wants to please her—and, for that matter, any woman who withholds her approval in favor of pursuing justice. On the Dearborn noise rockers’ debut,Attempted Martyr, he devotes an entire song to singing Kayrouz’s praises: that deep plum lipstick an exegesis forLysistrata, her “rose red wine” scent binding the triad of pre-Islamic Arabian goddesses. “It’s time to design a woman,” he howls. Prostitute needn’t resort tobegging for punishmentto prove their love—not when their splintering industrial post-punk already feels like getting run over by truck.\nMuch like Kayrouz, whofledthe Lebanese Civil War as a young woman and now fundscommunity spacesin her former homeland, Prostitute’s bold aesthetic choices risk concealing the fervency of their passion. OnAttempted Martyr, they wield guitars like wire-wrapped sledgehammers, each melody more densely thistled than the last. During “Senegal,” Ross Babinski’s metal riffs gurgle like they’re desperate for air. On “M. Dada,” drummer Andrew Kaster hammers down like he’s spawned additional limbs, racing to outpace bassist Dylan Zaranski; the higher Babinski’s fingers climb on the guitar, the more vertiginous the rataplan. The sheer volume of their collective experimental aggression makes “Judge” almost meditative.\nNoise rock frontmen are practically required to holler and scream like they’re losing their minds, and while Moe (whose last name doesn’t appear online) observes this unspoken rule, there’s something else driving his madness. With two hands pressed on his keyboard to cue samples of flutes and horns, he’s tethered to reality even while shouting out visions of bloody vengeance and religious ecstasy. As if to prove sanity is still within reach, he opens “Body Meat” in a dry post-punk deadpan before launching into a paranoid suicide proposal: “What am I worth if not glorified and adorned in flames?” Moe and Kaster’s lyrics can lacerate with image alone: hands sewn shut by needle and thread, bodies writhing in pools of spit, a human head impaled on a steeple. To callAttempted Martyr“intense” is somehow still underselling it.\nYet the most impactful parts ofAttempted Martyraren’t its crushing hooks or its relentless punk bacchanal. It’s Moe’s ability to turn the real-life nightmares of his Lebanese family and friends, war-torn realities reduced to the label of “foreign policy” in the U.S., into disturbingly poetic lyrics.Attempted Martyrwas written and recorded “under duress of a world in turmoil,” the bandstates, and is “dedicated to Lebanon, from Dearborn with love.” In recent months, Prostitute have performed at benefits forPalestine,Lebanon, andSudan. No wonder, then, that Moe screams about a suzerain’s tightening grip, apostles turned into pimps, and humans traded like slaves. “True glory’s claimed through gore,” he snarls on “All Hail,” “Just watch me push the button and make history repeat.” The song samples the Japanese experimental rock band Ground Zero’s 1997 epic “Consume Red,” looping a passage played on hojok until, much like in the original song, the instrument’s nasally calls take on an air of liberation by way of desecration. Both artists make a point of using repetition to overwhelm until it reaches a breaking point; in the silence that follows, a weight is lifted.\nParticularly for a debut,Attempted Martyris remarkably polished. Having found their footing in Michigan dive bars stippled with veterans patches and presidential doodles, Prostitute spent the past four years perfecting their live show without softening any of its rabid emotion. Although their distorted punk pairs well with Midwestern bands they’ve opened for, likethe ArmedorAngry Blackmen, Prostitute are no imitators. The album’s two slower numbers, “In the Corner Dunce” and “Harem Induction Hour,” demonstrate that their rage is equally effective in slow motion. After seven dizzying minutes of churn, the latter song closes the album by gradually decelerating and yawning into a high-pitched, blown-out swell not dissimilar to the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life.” “Was it only a daydream?” asks Moe, knowing we can hardly afford to be so naive."

    "review_text": "The Near End, the Dark Night, the County Linecouldn’t be a more welcoming, or easygoing, introduction toTakuro Okadaas a solo artist. Cherry-picked from recording sessions over the past decade, this never-before-released survey of the Tokyo-based musician’s career doubles as an album of ambient soundscapes and experimental improvisations examining how we evolve over time. After his college band Mori Wa Ikiteiru dissolved, Okada continued his self-taught studies, becoming a revered experimental guitarist and collaborating withHaruomi Hosono,Jim O’Rourke, andNels Cline. Now he’s amassed a big enough catalog to rifle through past work like a musical diary. The dusted-off recordings on his ninth solo album weave between the effortless dream-pop and introspective minimalist jazz of an overlooked virtuoso.\nEvery song onThe Near End, the Dark Night, the County Linebegins with guitar. Often it’s the sole instrument, though its different applications permit texture and depth of field. Okada fades into view with opener “Following Morning,” a 2022 recording that summons the warmth of a sunrise with electric guitar and, simultaneously, the disorienting whir of memory, as captured by gentle cymbal rolls and guitar synths that flutter in reverse. Though the fickleness of memory is a running theme, the album maintains its soothing presence through unbarred ambient groundwork and mellow jazz licks. In a two-part exercise dubbed “Ohme,” Okada first plays finger-picked acoustic guitar with the fussy attention of a busybody; in part two, he picks up a clarinet, violin, and xylophone—all of which, paradoxically, lighten the load and ease the pace.\nDon’t be embarrassed if you can’t decipher when Okada’s guitar imitates another instrument. In “The Room,” a blissfully sleepy track that stretches notes like yawns, he invokes a country sheen not dissimilar from themeditativeintuitionsofthe lateSusan Alcorn. It might sound like pedal steel, but it’s not—except when, two tracks later on “Before,” he actuallydoesuse pedal steel. This time, he plays faster, slicing between notes that hop up and down the scale in a trippy, theremin-esque sequence. The sound of trickling water, discreet but unmistakable, melts into the acrylic neon swirl of an LSD vision. (Okada could probably make a killing scoring luxury private sound baths.) The song that follows, “Mizu,” though recorded five years later, evokes those exact water sounds—plinking, dripping, rushing. But this time, Okada’s capturing it with his electric guitar and nothing else, manipulating notes with tranquility in mind.\nOrdered without an apparent timeline in mind,The Near End, the Dark Night, the County Linedrifts from older compositions to more recent ones like a brain flickering from one memory to the next. The earliest recording on the album dates to 2014: “Evening Song,” a romantic, stripped-back number with scaling blues melodies thatJohn Mayerwould milk dry. Okada plays gently, sounding starry-eyed, as if under the spell of love. Immediately afterwards comes “Taco Beach,” a 2023 exercise in slinky Arabic pop, where his Korg Mini POP and electric bass court a different type of lusty romance. Despite the album’s largely wordless nature, evocative moments can’t help but enter the frame: a curling blues guitar riff that’s interrupted by the shrill barks of a puppy in “Howlin’ Dog,” or the translucent echoes of electric guitar in “Mirror” that fan outward in waves of disillusionment. For a second, we might feel we can make out a scene from Okada’s past. The album’s leaps through time are its own source of congruency: It speaks to how the artist’s intuition hasn’t changed over the years, only sharpened."

    "review_text": "In an interview withRolling Stone,Marinadescribed her sixth album as a lesson in learning how to love again: “It can sound trite, but the ability to love is so powerful and brave. … [Princess of Power] is about teaching yourself—or re-teaching yourself—how to love.” Like most Marina albums post-FROOT, the Welsh pop star’s latest is rich in empowerment anthems that chart a metamorphosis from the despondent damsel of “Everybody Knows I’m Sad” to the courageous heroine of the title track and “Cuntissimo.” Inspired by the rhapsodic disco pop ofABBAandKylie Minogue,Princess of Powermoves with a clean, steady chug, but its dichotomy of feminine softness vs. strength comes off depressingly two-dimensional. The one-size-fits-all tracks feel like they rolled off a conveyor belt and the writing sometimes tips into childlike cliché.\nLike any disco-pop album,Princess of Poweris preoccupied with dancing and fun. The opening title track breaks out of Rapunzel’s tower to enter a Venusian disco haven; it’s practically aBarbieB-side. “I <3 You” is a straightforward disco sparkler updated with shades ofMagdalena Bay,CSS, andMadonna’s “Vogue.” Among the album’s many ’70s- and ’80s-inspired tracks, the liberation anthem “Rollercoaster” stands out mostly because it sounds a bit likeSleigh Bells: Over a booming bleachers stomp, Marina daydreams about skinnydipping, sex on the beach, and getting high off kisses.\nPrincess of Powerbears some similarity to Diamandis’ beloved concept recordElectra Heart, which used female archetypes (like “Homewrecker” or frustratedhousewife) to explore contemporary womanhood. But like key moments on that album,Princess of Powercan sound incredibly overproduced. Maximalism is Marina’s preferred method, and it’s worked in the past: “Lies” staged a breakup like a Greek tragedy, smashing together tidal waves of synth while Marina wailed about a lover’s failures.Princess of Powernever quite hits that impassioned high. “Final Boss” repurposes the 8-bit pirouettes from earlier track “Digital Fantasy,” then throws in a Kylie-esquerap segmentand aMortal Kombatsample. Before the final chorus, a pitched-up chipmunk voice squeaks: “Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle!” The effect is more gimmicky than clever as video-game metaphor overpowers emotional meaning.\nNear the album’s end comes “Adult Girl,” a spiritual sequel toElectra Heart’s “Teen Idle,” where a younger Marina yearned for an ideal (yet artificial) teenage dream. “Adult Girl” is exponentially bleaker. Over plinking piano like tears on cobblestone, Marina laments stolen youth. “Didn’t grow up in a normal world,” she sings, “and now I’m just an adult girl.” It’s sad to hear, though perhaps not in the way intended. Marina’s “Adult Girl” sounds resigned to her fate as a 39-year-old teenager, a lonely echo of a culture where adolescence seems to last indefinitely. But the song inspires more sympathy than empathy: You want better for her, particularly when, between coquette-as-trend and the “I’m just a girl”-ing of every minor inconvenience, we’re already surrounded with suggestions that real women are supposed to be too naive and incapable to function.\nPrincess of Power’s synthetic sound and overwrought wordplay smooth out the distinct tonal registers that ought to separate a weepy ballad like “Adult Girl,” a character-building nursery rhyme like “Butterfly,” and an aspiring kitsch artifact like “Cuntissimo.” According to Marina, being cuntissimo involves bottles of bubbly and ignoring your ex’s “U up?” texts. But haven’t we heard this before, and in abetter song? “Cuntissimo” charges ahead anyway with revved-up faux-Italo synths, baroque strings, and a ballroom neologism that lands like an accidental satire on 2020s pop. “Do people still say YOLO?” she wonders aloud. Even at its most outrageous,Princess of Powersuffers less from silliness than from safeness.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "Just more than halfway through her twenties, Ally Evenson has a couple questions for whoever’s in charge: “Am I who I’m growing into? Will I be more than just a face? Will I be more if I’m erased?” On the opening track of her debut album,BLUE SUPER LOVE,she hovers in a weightless void of shimmeringTHX Deep Notes, weighing the paths before her: to have “fun in hell or shitty heaven.” Evenson chooses violence. Right before its two-minute mark, “Shitty Heaven” breaks into an unexpected, grimy drum ’n’ bass vamp—during which, in theaccompanying visual, the Detroit singer-songwriter contemplates a gushing head wound and slips on a pair of sunglasses. Then—wham—she’s struck by a new rush of noise with all the force and pressure of an underwater vacuum implosion or especially violentTurnstileshow. By dramatically changing the song’s momentum twice in just a few minutes, Evenson sets the album’s mood as a house with the gas left on, liable to combust at the strike of a match.\nWhile Evenson’searlier Bandcamp releasesfit squarely in the mold of downcast indie rock,BLUE SUPER LOVEsets itself apart by leaning hard into smeared textures—motion blur, the buzz of a vocoder,the grain of a digital camera—and sharp edges. The melody on “Where Are You Going?”, one of the record’s sweetest, wouldn’t be out of place in the mouth ofGracie Abrams; still, distortion crackles overhead, while drums pummel and pop like something off thelatest Bully record. Evenson’s instincts have always leaned pop, and now she and producer Nydge have built a widescreen, electric sound to match. “You Poor Thing” has its loping rhythm periodically interrupted by screams and blasts of noise, as Evenson’s chiming guitar mocks the unfortunate soul to be on the receiving end of her vitriol. “You look pretty/on your knees,” she coos, and it’s hard to tell which lines come from her, and which she’s parrotting from the “golden coaster, fuckin’ freeloader” who’s the song’s target.\nEvenson’s voice—which is to say, both her writerly voice and her actual timbre—puts her in the fabulously bratty lineage ofthat dog.,Veruca Salt, andCharly Bliss. The way her tongue dances around the alliteration of “friends who fuck around” on “Cross My Fingers” injects its otherwise saccharine lyrics with a perfect dose of venom. Meanwhile, “I want you, and I need you, so come for me/and I want you, and I need you, so comfort me” from “Something In The Water” is Evenson’s own twisted version of “come right on me—I mean camaraderie,” delivered atop a bed of mellow pop-rock that fizzes like actual Pop Rocks. The storytelling onBLUE SUPER LOVEalso gets an assist from carefully deployed vocal effects. The breakdown of “Something In The Water” pans Evenson’s voice side to side as she sings “I’m always here, I’m always there,” and on “One Trick Pony,” an arsenal of glitches capture the effect of twisting oneself into the ideal lover in real time."

    "review_text": "Miami’s cityscape can feel like a living organism. TakeBrickell City Centre, a four-city-block condo-office-mall complex that literally breathes. It was designed to create a natural breeze in the Florida heat, so that the monstrous development would have to rely less on air conditioning. BCC is vaguely hideous on the outside, but inside its lines are clean, wavy, and oceanic, certainly gorgeous enough for a Sunglasses Hut. Brickell City Centre embodies the work ofArquitectonica, a local architecture firm that, since the 1970s, has remade Miami’s image with glass facades and curvy shapes. Their greatest buildings feel natural but also garishly artificial, and lend the city a hyperreal feeling—a sense of luxury and awe that defies the reality that the climate crisis couldupend lifein the city at any moment.\nProducerNick Leóncomes from Broward County, just north of Miami proper. Like Arquitectonica’s buildings, León’s music is pure Miami—the album’s press materials refer to it as Arquitectronica—reflecting the city’s mugginess but also its lively sounds, as well as an ominous menace around its prettiest resorts and waterfronts. León worked onA Tropical Entropyfor three years and named it after a phrase in Joan Didion’s 1987 bookMiami,which positioned the region as a sort of upside-down America thanks to its tropical heat and restive, crime-ridden political landscape. León approaches his South Florida warily but lovingly. He borrows rhythmic strains from its streets in the service of insular electronic music that gives us a glance at León’s own Miami: fun, but freakily unnerving if you really start looking around. There are moments of optimism and freedom, butA Tropical Entropyis the rare dance album that explores the seedier side of this milieu, rather than just the escape it can offer.\nThat’s probably because he’s stuck deep in it. Since the pandemic, León has become one of dance music’s most beloved producers, riding awave of hypearound Latin-influenced subgenres with dancefloor hits like 2022’s “Xtasis.” His music pairs excellent sound design and mainstream-ready melodies with rhythmic know-how that touches on perreo, tribal guarachero, and raptor house, among others. But it’s the dreamy dembow song “Bikini,” withErika de Casier, a released as a single last summer, that lays his intentions bare, following production credits withRosalía,Empress Of, andOklou: The dude wants to make pop music.\nThat desire bubbles to the surface onA Tropical Entropy, an album that sounds uncomfortable with León’s own dance music history, jumping from genre to genre as if he couldn't bear to sit still for more than a minute. Each track is short and turbulent, adding up to a brief 33-minute runtime that feels almost unceremonious for a debut album from a buzzy artist. Rippling drum patterns appear suddenly like inclement weather before turning a song inside out and leaving just as quickly. Even the poppier moments are indecisive and ephemeral. But listen closely and it feels lived in, inhabited by his close friends and made with a level of detail (and neurosis) more aligned with the bedroom than the club. It’s a more personal spin of the styles he's most closely associated with, turning the swing of dancehall and dembow into paranoid, palpitating heartbeats."

    "review_text": "Computer and recording works for girlsmight sound like a riff onAphex Twin’sSelected Ambient Works, but there’s a crucial distinction in the specification, “for girls.” Brooklyn-based multi-hyphenate Mari Maurice, a.k.a.more eaze, and Philadelphia electroacoustic explorerKaho Matsuitap into some of the murky ambiguity of Richard D. James’ ambient landmark, but on their first collaborative album, they highlight the warmth of shared experience rather than the isolation of the lone tinkerer. Their respective relocations—Maurice from Austin, and Matsui from Portland—brought the two prolific artists together; improvising and recording in a cold New York City apartment, they melded their styles, following what Mauricedescribedas the mutual desire “to see how our sounds could be sculpted around another artist’s melodic / compositional sensibilities.”\nThe two friends spent a series of frigid days stringing together experiments, overdubbing and blurring ideas like anemo-ambientVenn diagram. Maurice and Matsui play multiple roles, plucking and sliding across numerous guitars and ricocheting all kinds of electronic noises around the room. In a genre often characterized by solitude, they sound soothed and encouraged by each other’s company; for all the album’s abstracted drifting, the feel is cozy, the tones largely consonant.\nThe two artists have similarly eclectic discographies, and here, rather than opting for any particular style, they focus on finding a shared language. The ambient pop collage ofStrawberry Seasonand washed-out Americana oflacuna and parlorfind a foil in the plugged-in folktronica ofthe swordand lonely feedback meltdowns ofscrutiny portrait. Any icy edges have been melted down, resulting in nearly 80 minutes of glitchy, understated play. There’s no shortage of otherworldly soundscapes onComputer and recording works for girls, but the main thrust of the album is the inventive intimacy of hanging with a friend and trying out weird shit.\nBoth artists appear interested in excavating the inconsistencies of memory. The ghosts of familiar melodies fill the crevices of “2 lesbians and a broken radiator,” while “phone charger (crazy guitar solo)” reimagines the tectonic shifts of post-rock in hushed, candlelit terms.M. Sageadds incandescent clarinet to “dog sweater,” a fragmented mosaic in which no sound maintains its integrity for long. The undercurrent of emotion is most explicit on “geoguessr,” featuring hyper-online pop experimenter8485; the song’s heartworn glitch-folk is the closest thing to a ballad on the album.\nThe duo’s songs come alive in carefully assembled layers of sound. “My chains” finds beauty in chilly, flickering drone, attempting to render the air between them as vividly as the music in their heads, and landing somewhere between aMetroidsoundtrack and the work ofLia Kohl. In the album’s most startling moment, a distorted radio comes to life and starts blasting Augustana’s “Boston,” blurrily jumbling time and place."

Enterskaiwater, amasochistic yearnerwhose ownpinkPrintEPs trade despotism for delirium. The UK-born crooner grew up on swag-era saviors, the Nickis and Kanyes and Drakes who soundtracked aweightless, optimistic cultural moment. As that optimism has devolved—who doesn’t feelmanic in America?—the hedonistic highs of last decade have given way to deeper, darker lows.Terror basstortures speaker systems; dark plugg draws out demons; rage music reigns over angsty teens. When this generation gets apinkPrint, it’s a frenetic fever dream constantly threatening to combust.\nskaiwater’s eclectic output—a gushy hybrid of Jersey Club, pop-punk, and post–Whole Lotta Redrage—paints a vivid portrait of a heart on fire. Originally released on her alt SoundCloud account in February and April,pinkPrints1and2are, as ever, frothing with desire. But this desire never feels depressive, which is a testament to how fun, even if fierce, these EPs make apoplectic lust feel. Entirely self-produced and spiritually indebted to the 2010s, their uncleared samples and “Trap-A-Holics!” tags don’t only summon the swag era but subvert it, grafting its weightlessness onto rawer, more visceral realities. A longing Rihanna promises to “Kiss It Better”; a lovesick skaiwater would rather their ex kiss their ass. The Tumblr-tinted backdrop reflects not only lost love, but also a lost time.\nProduction is constantly the difference between progress and pastiche. Take the pulsating “candy,” a shape-shifting squall that turnsMk.gee’s “Candy” into a club banger, then turnsthatinto a rage remix ofPARTYNEXTDOOR’s “Recognize.” A standout of the sparsepinkPrint 1, it thrives on bug-eyed mischief: transforming, then transcending touchstones that seem too sacred to be tinkered with. On “use me,” skaiwater constructs a Rolling Loud–ready trap stomper from the bones of aSabrina Carpentersong. It’s so zany that it’s kind of cathartic. Less so is “we didn’t get the memo,” which forges a jerk beat from “Moment 4 Life,” only to drag-and-dropDrake’s entire verse at the end. It’s a rare miss: Most of the time, the samples are so well-placed that they could pass for features. It feels like watching someone playMyTeamwith the past 15 years of music.\nThis effect is perfected onpinkPrint 2, an inventive sequel that doubles its counterpart in size and scope. The swag era once again joins us via sample—Frank Ocean,Rihanna, Nicki Minaj—but skaiwater also remixes melodic peers, wailing her own love songs over the ones in her playlist. ABeabadoobeeballad mutates into a bit-crushed, shit-talking rage thumper (“allah”);PinkPantheressfights for her life over blasts of gut-rearranging low end on a searing club anthem (“cashapp”). It feels like a DJ set hosted by baby-voicePlayboi Cartiin whichever circle of Helltdfbuys his distortion pedals. And it feels, also, vaguely familiar: We’ve all thought of a song, kept thinking about it, started wondering what it might sound like with a kick, or a chord change, or the topline of some other song, or a different guest verse. ThepinkPrintEPs are no different, which is what makes their delirium so rewarding. Somewhere behind skaiwater the cracked producer, you can always make out skaiwater the fan."

    "review_text": "Every field recording is a virtual reality.Joshua Bonnettaunderstands that precept: The Canadian artist eschews “authentic” reproductions of any space, openly embracing subjectivity. “I abstract the sounds,” Bonnettahas saidof his 2016 albumLago, “so that they would align more with my experience and the feeling of what I got from that place.” A personal perspective comes to the fore in his experimental documentaries, too.El Mar La Mar, his 2017 collaboration with director J.P. Sniadecki, placed oral histories alongside audio of the Sonoran desert, painting the U.S.-Mexico border as a landscape of trauma and bureaucratic racism. In 2020’sThe Two Sights, he portrayed the epistemological reality of clairvoyant townspeople in the Outer Hebrides by eschewing diegetic sound. More than most field recordists, Bonnetta finds truth in the edit.\nThe impossibility of objectivity is a central idea inThe Pines, Bonnetta’s monumental four-disc, four-hour album. Its premise sounds like a lark: Over a year, he recorded 8,760 hours of material from a single pine tree in upstate New York. Utilizing a passive monitoring device primarily meant for conservation research, he left the recorder alone for prolonged stretches of time, visiting periodically only to change the batteries and storage cards. After poring over his material, he spent three years constructing pieces that represent each season. The listening experience is dense but easy, obvious yet shrouded in mystique.\nIt can be daunting to press play on an album so large in scope, but the tracks flow smoothly and capture an incredibly active locale rife with varied textures. The beginning of “Spring” features the magnified sounds of something creaking—a result of the microphone’s uncommon vantage—and it feels uncanny the way it recalls the noise of a slowly opening door. This teasing unknowability lurks amid the more standard sounds of birds, animals, and water. There’s a low rumbling sound that I can only describe as a quickly dribbled basketball, and its repeated presence throughout the hour-long track is confounding. When a cloud of muted uproar arrives 42 minutes in, it’s more than likely a multitude of animals making communal noise, but it also feels like the distant sound of a cheering crowd. Such ambiguity makesThe Pinesa constant thrill.\nIt is difficult to tell if Bonnetta simply stitched together waveforms in a linear fashion, or layered multiple noises from different moments. Sometimes we hear the lovely sound of a black-capped chickadee, its buoying melodic phrase puncturing the noise of other birdsong. It’s akin to a riveting ensemble piece, but the richness of sound and species feels almost too dense—it could very well be a collage of pre-recorded sound, or a testament to how removed humans are from nature. Our invasiveness also comes to mind when we hear a noisy vehicle pierce the early minutes of “Summer”; very few birds can be heard at all. When rain pours down at the end of the track, animals falling silent as they take cover or scurry away from the soundfield, it is tempting to see humanity’s impact as similarly transformative."

    "review_text": "How much of our self-worth is tied to outward perception? And what’s lost when national identity speaks on behalf of individuals? When you grow up in the open prairies of Western Canada like singer-poet Karsyn Henderson did, giving in to the draw of a bustling city population and its promise of fame almost feels sinful. But when trading rural Alberta for the cosmopolitan Montréal to giveTruck Violencea fighting chance, he and his bandmates refused to sever their roots. Instead, they proudly tether themselves to the oft-misunderstood province while admitting their racing thoughts thrived in the city’s fast-paced environment. The avant-garde punk quartet’s debut album,Violence, soundtracks this bridging of opposites by soldering jarring music genres together—noise rock, bluegrass, sludge metal, experimental post-hardcore—like towering brutalist sculptures welded from rusty steel beams.\nReleased last summer on Mothland and now getting a vinyl rerelease courtesy of Southern Lord, the metal label home toSunn O)))andPower Trip,Violenceis ballsy and weird in ways that Truck Violence convince you are normal. They open the album with pummeling blast beats straight out of death metal and toss them into a slosh of shoegaze guitars, sobering dropouts, and a new-wave bass line. “Lecture” clears away the sludge with syncopated drumming and an isolated guitar riff that creeps closer with each measure until its mounting anxiety latches onto the listener and the whole band barges back into frame to crack your skull open with lashing noise rock. Truck Violence repeatedly hurl themselves around with this reckless abandon, but find ways to catch themselves before they hit the cement floor, too. Metalcore and drone dominate “The gash” until guitarist Paul Lecours strolls in with plucky banjo—a move so left-field yet self-assured, it’s like high school students clearing a circle around the quiet kid for his interpretive dance moves at prom. Despite a classic combination of heavy and quiet,Violenceis never predictable or formulaic; its music is more akin to the artful, experimental metal typically courted by San Francisco label The Flenser, likeChat Pile’sGod’s Countryor Elizabeth Colour Wheel’sNocebo.\nMuch ofViolenceconcerns itself with desire and the guilt of coveting attention. As Henderson begs for compliments—“I’ll never be interesting enough to have a collection of prose/written about me, and/Ultimately that’s my goal/to be written about,” he howls on “Undressed you layn’t before”—what appears to be a personal pursuit doubles as a stand-in for covertly craving peer recognition amidst social divides. Other provinces paint Alberta as “theTexasofCanada,” meant to insinuate the province is ripe with farmers, oil reserves, and addicts. But Truck Violence embrace that rural culture at their shows by dressing in camo and trapper caps, spray painting a rifle on their bed sheet banner, and dragging generators outdoors to play under bridges and in the woods. On the thrashing “Drunk to death,” Henderson tells the story of a loner with nothing to his name but apathy and alcohol, surrounded by farmland. “Is it so much that I feel this intensely?” he screams, a rewording of the human right to dream. Who’s to say this guy is less interesting than a wealthy Toronto painter, especially as the song’s protagonist describes the brown and yellow hues of tilled fields as an inverted ceiling of brambly coffers?"

    "review_text": "What would it take to make you return to the one place you never wanted to go back to? To embrace the thing that everyonethinksthey know about you? ForBeirut’s Zach Condon it took a circus—specifically, the Swedish troupe Kompani Giraff, which commissioned the 18 tracks onA Study of Lossesfor a stage show of the same name. On the company’s website, you can see footage of acrobats tumbling, soaring, and gyrating to the harried croon of “Caspian Tiger,” the first single from Beirut’s seventh album.\nIf you read that and cringed, you’re not alone. Condon has said that when he was first approached about writing a soundtrack for a circus, “a certain amount of “Elephant Gun”-era trauma initially came rushing up,” a reminder of a time when he had been pigeonholed, he says, “as a whimsical circus waif,” accompanied by “sepia-toned images of penny farthings and perhaps lion tamers with handlebar moustaches.” But after seeing videos of Kompani Giraff’s work and reading an abstract of German writer Judith Schalansky’sVerzeichnis einiger Verluste, a novel steeped loss and impermanence on which Giraff’s new project would be based, Condon changed his mind and composed the 11 songs and seven extended instrumental themes that make upA Study of Losses.\nSomething about writing in such atypical circumstances appears to have flipped a switch in Condon. About a third of the record does sound a lot likeGulag Orkestar. “Villa Sacchetti,” with its rousing brass, waltzing rhythms, and plucked strings, is pure early Beirut, as is “The Moonwalker,” all massed voices, accordion, and the lingering shade of ukulele. Elsewhere, though, Condon has hit on a new,Tangerine Dream-ish direction. “Ghost Train” ambles along over surging electronic pulses, like the German’s synth pioneers’ classic arpeggiated drift or perhaps evenBarker’s recent work. “Guericke’s Unicorn,” meanwhile, sounds like an ’80s synth-pop hit that’s been overexposed to sunlight. Condon has worked with synths before, notably on 2019’sGallipoli, but they have never quite been this prominent, golden electronic lines unfurling over his songs in sunny coils.\nBeirut’s charm—or perhaps curse—is that Condon’s baritone voice and gliding vocal melodies are so distinctive that even on 2023’sHadsel, an album that leaned heavily on church organ, recorded on a remote Norwegian island, Beirut still sounded a lot like Beirut. But this is no bad thing when Condon is in such rich songwriting form. It may be thatVerzeichnis einiger Verluste’s themes particularly resonated or, as Condon says, that he was inspired by the circus as a piece of art that transcends live music or theatre. ButA Study of Losseshas some of Condon’s most effortless songwriting in years, melodies flowing with the easy appeal of the best ofLon GislandandGulag Orkestar. “Villa Sacchetti” and “Tuanaki Atoll” don’t sound like the leftover scraps of Beirut’s debut album, they sound like prime cuts, while “Guericke’s Unicorn” is bittersweet yet rousing and addictive.\n“Mare Nectaris,” the album’s penultimate song, initially sounds like a low-key electronic ramble. Then Condon’s voice comes in, repeating the phrase, “You can’t be above all this,” as the music throbs below him. Is it a message to Kompani Giraff’s high-flying acrobats? To Beirut’s fan base? Or to Condon himself, a reminder to relax and let the ideas flow, no matter what other people might think? Whatever the case, it’s good advice:A Study of Lossesis an example of the peculiar magic that can happen under seemingly absurd circumstances.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

    "review_text": "“Who said being sad is not a crime?”Shuraasks onI Got Too Sad for My Friends. Regardless of the phrase’s origins, the English singer-songwriter seems blithely unafraid of any carceral ramifications. In the album’s opening song, she relays “crying in the backseat of a taxi in Tokyo”; later, she’s “out here in America/And I’m so sad that I am.” She wonders if “maybe I got too sad for my friends,” then, on the very next song, comes to a conclusion: “I got too down around my friends.” Occasionally, she looks on the bright side: “If I die,” she sings, “at least I don’t have to pick out a shirt to wear.” (And though she likely meant the question rhetorically: For the record,it was Arthur Russell.)\nPerhaps it wouldn’t surprise you, then, to learn that Shura wrote her third album in the midst of a mid-pandemic bout of depression and anxiety: stuck at home after a canceled tour, isolated from family and friends. Nearly all the songs onI Got Too Sad for My Friendswallow in these particular doldrums. She’s no stranger to an album-length emotional throughline; her debut,Nothing’s Real, focused squarely on romantic yearning, and its follow-up,forevher, traced the head rush of new love. And whileI Got Too Sad’s emotional tenor can occasionally feel one-note, its warm, lush sound offers a counterbalance to its gloomy lyrics.\nShura filled her previous two albums with bubbly synth pop, and some of that style carries over here: “World’s Worst Girlfriend” and “Recognise” are awash in ’80s-inspired shimmery synths and dramatic gated drums. But mostly, the album sounds earthier; dotted with woodwinds, keys, and organ, it leans more towards chamber pop than psychedelic dancefloor bops. “Leonard Street” is buoyed by a sauntering bassline and plucky keys; “America” is led by a gentle, wandering clarinet; on “I Wanna Be Loved by You,” a singalong choir of friends joins Shura on the chorus. She has retained, too, her ear for detailed production—consider the synth squiggles on “Online” or the layered harmonies of “Tokyo”—giving the record a rich, lively sound. The mature palette suits the reflective tone, though the overall atmosphere can start to feel a littletoomood-stabilized, even when, in the album’s second half, she dips into groovy soft rock.\nOn the album’s cover, Shura sports armor, like a knight fending off the small army of illustrated goblins that surround her. The lyrics aren’t brash or defensive, though; they’re pensive and unguarded—often straightforwardly so, circling the same themes of isolation and depression. She mentions anger in the elegant, synth-led “Online” and the funk-lite ballad “I Wanna Be Loved by You,” but each time, the emotion is blown away on the song’s gentle breeze; there’s no outburst, no heat, as Shura’s voice barely rises above a whisper. WhenCassandra JenkinsandHelado Negro—heroes of this strand of cosmic, contemplative melancholia—show up on a couple tracks, they serve as unfortunate benchmarks of the introspective depths Shura doesn’t quite reach. Being sad isn’t a crime—but, on its own, it’s not an entirely thrilling muse, either."

    "review_text": "In 2021, songwriter Jessica Dobson and her band,Deep Sea Diver, gave an arresting performance insidethe famous “red room” fromTwin Peaks. Or, not exactly; Deep Sea Diver had recreated the room for a quarantine-era home concert series, their attempt to inject a dose of wonder and inspiration into the interminable sameness of lockdown. The meticulous backdrop seemed fitting for a band whose explosive indie rock traffics in carefully calibrated dynamics, and Dobson’s widescreen, off-kilter soundscapes seemed right at home inside the Lynchian dreamworld.\nBillboard Heartis Deep Sea Diver’s fourth album, and their first after the breakout success of 2020’sImpossible Weight. That album was the band’s first release on a label, and landed Deep Sea Diver an opening spot on tour withPearl Jamand their first placement on aBillboardchart. ThoughBillboard Heartcomes in the wake of success, it’s not so much a victory lap as a record of grit—the sheen in its propulsive, riff-laden songwriting not the glow of self-satisfaction but the blistering aftermath of hard work.\nDeep Sea Diver deftly modulates their energy over the course ofBillboard Heart, whose front half zigzags through cinematic scene-setting and jittery accelerations, and whose back half mellows into a more pensive slow burn. Dobson was formerly a touring guitarist forthe ShinsandBeck, and her expressive, commanding playing shows off the mastery of an in-demand instrumentalist. Tracks like “See in the Dark” and “Let Me Go” are rooted by blown-out, gnarled guitar solos; on the latter, in which she duets with singer-songwriter Madison Cunningham, their raging guitars intertwine like ivy climbing a crumbling stone wall. There’s a new level of yearning intensity to Dobson’s vocals, too—in “Emergency” and “Shovel,” she seems to sing the verses through gritted teeth, then lets loose a howl, belting like her anxiety is a predator that needs scaring off.\nBillboard Heart’s songs are detail-studded and dense, filled out by Dobson’s bandmates, drummer Peter Mansen and synth player Elliot Jackson, and a handful of additional contributors adding bass, strings, steel guitar, and more. Mansen and co-producer Andy D. Park pack “What Do I Know” with insistent percussion and drum loop samples; “Emergency”’s frenetic energy is kept aloft by indefatigable drumming and whining synths; a twinkling riff and winding bassline add sweetness to “Tiny Threads.” Nearly every song crashes to a crescendo at some point, and even the softest moments tend to end in controlled chaos—like “Loose Change,” which builds from a softly strummed murmur to a screech as Dobson howls, “Everything is changing/And I’m learning to love.” When words fail, there’s always a guitar solo, as in the cathartic, frenzied playing that ends the desperate-yet-hopeful “See in the Dark.”"

    "review_text": "At a moment when “reality” is mostly a matter of opinion, the teenage rapperNettspendappears: a 17-year-old cipher who is post-rage, post-race, post-everything. The impish high school dropout broke through late last year with bursts of songs like “drankdrankdrank” and “shine n peace”—dazed, disoriented snippets that channeled the sensation of sun-stroke or snow blindness. Connoisseurs of this particular strain of blown-out Gen Z party rap, as popularized byxaviersobasedand his 1c34 collective, have dubbed the genre “jerk”—not to be confused with the California jerk music of 15 years ago that birthedthatotherkooky, fiercely divisive cloud rapper(whose Zen-ish concept of “based” is not be confused with the edgelord definition it’s known as now). Nettspend, or Gunner Shepardson from suburban Virginia, bleached his hair, and promptly became exalted on subreddits and Discord servers as the Bieber, or the Cobain, of fried internet rap—though to be fair, it’s hard to tell whether his evangelists are being serious at all.\nYour tolerance for this music depends upon how quickly you can get past the image of a small Caucasian child who raps mostly about opiates and sluts, to the extent that his raps are “about” anything at all. My own knee-jerk reaction to the video for “2024 Freestyle”—where, between slurry one-liners on sipping lean and shooting guns, he bounces around a rented condo like a babysitter’s nightmare—was a mixture of revulsion and deep shame for ever being starry-eyed on the topic of “real trap shit.” But push past the ick factor, or lean all the way into it, and you might catch yourself vibing to Nettspend’s debut album,BAD ASS F*CKING KID, or arriving at the notion that a lean-addled shitposter whose history with firearms seems mostly based in Roblox is exactly the rap wunderkind America deserves.\nIt’s hardly profound to note that this twitchy, over-stimulated music is the product of a life whose action happens in a phone, songwriting included; while Nett recordedBAFKat least partially in-studio, he made his early tracks using a free app called BandLab, often in a matter of minutes. What’s fascinating is how polished these spontaneous compositions can be: songs whose scattered pieces coalesce into a glittering whole, like fine cubic zirconia. At a glance, a song like “Leader”—with a beat like an oldSalemsong bit-crushed to oblivion—registers as beyond vapid, a disjointed string of corny boasts and buzzwords. But notice how he builds momentum through internal rhyme, or the way he litters hooks with dumb-on-purpose malapropisms (“Leave it in the sack/Money full of bag”). Call it the event horizon for the punch-in mode of recording, whose popularity in the past decade-plus has rendered rap discursive and surreal. I’m not saying it’s ingenious, but it’s at least amusing."

    "review_text": "Some industrious fan should organize theLordewalking tour of New York—people would pay money to see where contemporary pop’s most famous mystic has deposited trails of her magic dust. Start at the Flame Diner near Columbus Circle, where she worked late into the night writing lyrics for 2017’sMelodrama; cut across the park to the Met, where she oncestole that forkas a souvenir for her mom. Swing down to Canal Street where, as she tells us in the opening moments of her fourth album,Virgin, she’s getting her ears pierced and her aura read. Then across the Williamsburg Bridge to end the nightdancing at Baby’s All Right.\nFor her last album, 2021’sSolar Power, Lorde took an extended beachside sabbatical, channeling her retreat into psychedelic, somewhat stifled acoustic pop that felt out of place and time. Afterward, four years ago now, she plugged back in and bought an apartment in Manhattan. She befriended artists and read a lot of books; she went through a breakup, came to terms with an eating disorder, and began to inhabit a more fluid understanding of her gender.\nThis broad set of circumstances—moving to and finding oneself in the city—has precipitated so much art that it almost feels too obvious to bother pointing out. But some make the familiar story revelatory. I think of Nan Goldin, whoseBallad of Sexual Dependencyis a vital record of queer downtown New York in the 1980s. Her photos—flash-lit, unsentimental images of tangled lovers and friends—are lodged in my head as I listen toVirgin, Lorde’s gritty, tender, and often transcendent ode to freedom and transformation.\nMaybe Lorde agrees with the masses thatSolar Powernever hit quite the same asMelodrama. Maybe that’s whyVirgincircles back to the body-friendly, programmed drums and synthetic sparks she left in 2017, with a lead single so analogous toMelodrama’sthat she could have just called it “Blue Light.” Former right-hand manJack Antonoffis absent—Lorde’s primary creative partner here isJim-E Stack, who has worked withBon IverandCaroline Polachek, with additional contributions from pop producer du jourDan Nigro. The new collaborators settle into familiar rhythms. LikeMelodrama,Virgintouches off from heartbreak and swims gracefully through its aftermath. Its title is unrelated to sexual purity—if anything, Lorde’s references to sex here are exceptionally frank. Rather, it signals a state of innocence and exploration, of hunger for experience, that seems to have pulled Lorde back to an earlier version of herself."

    "review_text": "As incongruous as the concept of an “influential harsh noise record” might sound,Kevin Drumm’s 2002 albumSheer Hellish Miasmais the most influential harsh noise record of the 21st century. When scumfuckers likeWolf EyesandHair Policewere painting America’s bloody noise underground with the rotted hues of VHS horror in the early ’00s, Chicago’s Drumm, a fellow traveler and seasoned sound artist, emerged with something sleeker and sharper. Instead of lurking behind the scene’s juvenile-hall notebook scribbles and spray-painted CD-Rs,Sheer Hellish Miasmacame packaged in the clinical house design of Austrian electronic label Mego. The music wasn’t “damaged” or “limping” or “wounded” like the best American noise at the time, but was instead assured and even clinical, like the work of European laptop futzersPita,Fennesz, orRussell Haswell.Sheer Hellish Miasmawas ostensibly a guitar record inspired by Nordic black metal, but you would be forgiven for thinking the otherworldly tumult was made by mouse clicks and mania alone; its longform squalls resemble blizzards, static, roiling fires, sputtering hard drives, or a corpse-painted band in a sound clash with a wood chipper.\nAs a noise record that simultaneously channeled ambient, drone, and extreme metal,Sheer Hellish Miasmahad unlikely reach.The Wiredubbed it a noise-music classic in a 2004 primer, and then—six months later—claimed its centrality to something they called “Subterranean Metal,” breaking containment in the middle ofSunn O)))mania. Artists from the fringes of dark ambient techno—Helm,the Haxan Cloak,Samuel Kerridge—would throw Drumm into their DJ mixes. Iranian composerSiavash Aminicalledthe 2002 record “the noise album that convinced me noise could be compositional, as well as visceral, and sometimes improvisational.” Reissued in 2007 and again in 2010,Sheer Hellish Miasmajust kept on glorping its way across the underground like Larry Cohen’sThe Stuff.But Drumm busied himself with quieter and more desolate works: 2008’s cavernous voidsuiteImperial Distortion, 2009’s gorgeous odysseyImperial Horizon, 2014’s confrontationally quietTrouble, and the mountains of deliberately paced sound art posted to hisBandcamp page.\nThough Drumm never completely shied away from noise, it was Erstwhile Records founder Jon Abbey who convinced him to venture back into the frostbitten tundras of his most famous nightmare. The imposing sequelSheer Hellish Miasma II—95 minutes long, spread across two discs—certainly feels like the Drumm of a particular vintage: CD-only, blocky black-and-gold artwork,Nmperign’s Greg “Dana Flugel” Kelley returning for guest trumpet (good luck locating exactly where). But Drumm’s credits—“electronics, tapes, microphone, computer assistance”—are notably missing the original’s crucial ingredients, “guitar” and “pedals.” Instead of emulating the brushstrokes of the former, Drumm is building a pure noise wall and painting a Picasso on it."

    "review_text": "At the beginning ofPinkPantheress’ new mixtape,Fancy That, the 24-year-old singer and producer has just been hit by the full force of an absurdly potent strain of weed and is starting to feel the world tilt off its axis. “Illegal” swerves straight into peak time, growing more massive and colorful as it crashes through the speakers. If the record’s first seconds are slightly disorienting, it hardly seems to register for the singer—she has to be the most poised stoned person on the planet. Pink’s voice is the cool center of the music’s raging party, beckoning us to follow as she sashays down the rabbit hole. “My name is Pink and I’m really glad to meet you,” she deadpans by way of introduction, “You’re recommended to me by some people.” From here on out she has zero intention of slowing things up.\n“Illegal” begins like many of PinkPantheress’ best songs to date: musically busy, charmingly conversational, and locked into a hazy headspace conjured by vintage samples and the once and future sound of drum’n’bass. By now the producer has made a specialty out of using thundering breaks and sparkling melodies to jolt her train of thought and chart a comet’s trail out of her feelings. But unlike her past releases,Fancy Thatoffers no daydreaming detours or moments of zoomed-out introspection. The face she puts on is easy, forthright, and effortlessly cool—she’s arrived at a point of clarity and she’s never been more ready to dance.\nInitially, it might have been tempting to assume that, because her songs were so short and went viral on TikTok so easily, her work was too low-stakes and thinly sketched for sustained success. But though “PinkPantheress” began as an anonymous handle, it’s since become an undeniable signature. Her 2023 debut,Heaven Knows, polished the scrappiness of her early work into tracks that consistently managed to clear the two- and even three-minute mark. While that record yielded some undeniable gems (see theJoanna Newsom-at-the-rave lament “Ophelia” or the moony 2-step of “Mosquito”), her bite-sized approach couldn’t always hold its own at full length. Although it won’t shut downjokes about her track times, the 20-minuteFancy Thatis PinkPantheress’ most exciting and fully realized release yet.\nFancy Thatis a portal into an alternate universe where UK garage successfully crossed the Atlantic and fashion froze in 2006. But apart from the more superficial choices (the cover’sLily Allen–inspired graphic collage, the decision to shoot the music video for “Stateside” in a JCPenneyparking lot), Pink’s world-building plays out most vividly in her music. After largely forgoing samples onHeaven Knows,Fancy Thatis an encyclopedia of references that far exceeds stale Y2K cosplay. Subtle clues like thePanic! at the Discostrings that segue into “Tonight” or the hilarious, stoned call-and-response with aNardo Wicksample on “Noises” are juxtaposed against some thrilling acts of appropriation. “Illegal” blazes into the mix by isolating and supercharging the synths fromUnderworld’s “Dark & Long (Dark Train Mix),” while “Girl Like Me” takes aBasement Jaxxsample and spins it out into a roaring speed garage banger. British dance music has caught a second life across Gen Z pop; PinkPantheress’ tour through thehardcore continuumis lived-in and substantial, bringing the legacies of producers like Sunship, Adam F, and MJ Cole into the present while strutting her own glittering new path."

    "review_text": "Every punk agrees that Black Flag were an important band. Few can agree on what exactly made them so. Survey 10 people sportingtattoos of the four bars, and you’ll get at least 10 different opinions on which album is their greatest, whether their live records and demos are better than any of their proper albums, who was their best singer (or bassist or drummer), whether they were better with one guitarist or two, when they started to suck, and whether band mastermind Greg Ginn is a genius guitar player, a jazzbo wanker, or a genius jazzbo wanker. With Black Flag, dysfunction and debate are as much a part of the brand as lurid Raymond Petitbon artwork.\nBut amid all the division that engulfs the band, there remains no greater lightning rod thanMy War—the San Andreas Fault of hardcore, where, with a simple flip from Side 1 to Side 2, the fastest and most ferocious band in punk instantly transformed into the doomiest, most despairing band in metal.My Warinstantly drew a line between those who saw hardcore as a specific style of jackhammering rock music and those who viewed it as a broader philosophy of nihilism and negation—one that might very well be used to dismantle hardcore itself. By radically altering Black Flag’s musical DNA,My Warrealized their fundamental spirit of contrarianism.\nOriginally formed in Hermosa Beach, California, circa 1976, Black Flag (né Panic) didn’t just expand punk rock’s capacity for velocity and violence, they effectively extinguished the genre’s last vestiges of glam-schooled vamping and pub-rock reverence. For all their anti-rock-star posturing, first-wave punks like Johnny Rotten and Joe Strummer nonetheless came equipped with showbizzy stage names and carefully cultivated aesthetics, and it didn’t take long for them to become icons themselves. Black Flag, by contrast, were T-shirt-and-jeans misfits who, early on, rejected the notion of the rock band as a tight-knit gang. By the time they made their recorded debut in 1978, they were already on their fourth bassist and second drummer; over the next two years, they’d cycle through three lead vocalists—Keith Morris, Ron Reyes, and Dez Cadena—each of whom lasted in the role just long enough to cut a pivotal EP and establish their respective faction of loyalists.\nIn effect, early Black Flag demonstrated that the person singing the song was less important than the energy and intent behind it, and the participatory response it elicited. And the band would find its longest-serving frontman through a veritable act of punk-rock karaoke: At a June 1981 gig at New York venueA7, Black Flag invited a fan-turned-friend onstage to sing “Clocked In”—an apt choice, given that he’d driven all the way from D.C., and had to make the five-hour trip back in time for his early morning shift at a local Häagen-Dazs. Cadena was contemplating a switch from lead vocals to rhythm guitar, so a few days later, the band summoned the ice-cream shop employee back to New York for a rehearsal. After a single session, Henry Garfield was invited to join Black Flag on their cross-country tour, for which he initially served as a roadie and Cadena’s understudy at the mic. Upon settling in L.A., he adopted a new, tougher-sounding surname, Rollins, and laid down vocal tracks to the songs that Ginn and bassist Chuck Dukowski had written for the band’s full-length debut,Damaged, an album that—from its shocking cover photo to itslight-speed 33-second strikesto its anti-everything worldview—forever changed the word “hardcore” from an adjective to a noun."

He could sing, play piano, and add some trumpet, too, a little likeGarth Hudsonin search of his best setting.

When McClements finally debuted under his own name as a solo instrumentalist on 2021’s warm and inquisitiveA Hole in the Fence, the accordion served as the center but not the whole story. McClements would stretch or refract the sound with sundry effects, forever raising questions about where he ended and his circuits began. How, his music dared you to wonder, could the much-lampooned accordion do allthat?\nMcClements’ astounding second album,On a Painted Ocean, does not bother with such borders—or, really, much fealty to the accordion at all. Composed in part on an organ in a Pasadena church, these pieces were ultimately lifted by contributions from explosive New Orleans saxophonist Aurora Nealand and ingenious electronics explorerRachika Nayar. Fluorescent sounds flicker at the start of “Cloud Prints” like neon light reflecting off dirty glass; by track’s end, though, Nealand howls through her horn likeAlbert Ayleras McClements sculpts a pillow-top drone beneath her. “Washed Up” suggests some oddballTim Heckernocturne, interlaced accordion lines spiraling through electronic phosphorescence like the outstretched arms of an octopus. With apologies to Lawrence Welk andPauline Oliveros, it adheres to no known notion of what an “accordion album” might entail.\nLike so much of McClements’ past work,On a Painted Oceanremains wide-eyed and big-hearted, bound together by an unflagging sense of candor that makes these seven pieces about much more than what he can do to, or pair with, his accordion. The expanded palette only makes what’s here more affecting.On a Painted Oceanhas the tonal splendor ofKali Malone’s work but the emotional ballast ofPopol Vuhand post-rock.

    "review_text": "Angus Fairbairn used to carry knives. He didn’t mind if he scared people. But that was several identities ago; anyone who meets the Mancunian poet, saxophonist, and band leader today would be shocked by the revelation. Under his nom de scène,Alabaster DePlume, he disarms with his earnestness, his gentleness, his vulnerability. “Every time I say ‘I,’ it means something different. Because I grow,” hesays. “People don’t last. We don’t want them to last. We want them to grow.” To remind himself of this, DePlume memorializes his past selves with the six small tattoos of stick men that feature on the cover of his new album. Now, he’s more likely to wield metaphors than knives, as in its title:A Blade Because a Blade Is Whole.\nBlades are symbols of forgiveness for DePlume, less about sharp edges than integrity and strength. “The blade, that divides, is whole,” he writes in his recent poetry book,Looking for my value: prologue to a blade. “Healing is the forming of a whole.” These thoughts arose in the wake of his gorgeous 2022 album,GOLD, on which he encouraged his audience to “go forward in the courage of your love” and be “brazen like a baby.”A Bladeis that record’s de facto sequel, a quiet moment of reflection after a bold call to action. It’s more restrained but just as urgent: a pen scratching out a manifesto rather than a rallying cry through a megaphone.\nDePlume has become a mainstay at London jazz hub Total Refreshment Centre over the past decade, flourishing in its communal atmosphere. WhereasGOLDharnessed this energy through spontaneous sessions with unrehearsed musicians,A Bladeis carefully composed and arranged. That doesn’t mean the record is any less collaborative; string and vocal arrangements byMacie Stewart, Donna Thompson, and Momoko Gill are crucial to its easy grandeur. On opener “Oh My Actual Days,” saxophone, piano, and violin limn an extravagant but soothing world—a palace in which you can kick off your shoes. At the song’s climax, DePlume traces out figures with his sax, rising higher and higher but never straining, backed by crashing cymbals and dizzying strings. The main melody returns with a single voice that guides the band through a careful diminuendo, a perfect introduction to DePlume’s message: These are our days on Earth, our actual days, limited in number and every one precious. Remember to savor their magnificence and to navigate them with care."

    "review_text": "Memorable autobiographies typically commit to one of two routes: recount a real-life experience with the intrigue of a gripping plot, or keep the details vague in favor of evoking strong shared feelings instead. On their fourth album, Brooklyn alt-rock bandMommarevisit a life-changing stretch of their 2022 tour in a way that’s personally cathartic for co-founders Allegra Weingarten and Etta Friedman, while offering sentimental universality for the rest of us. Whether they’ve blurred the details to protect themselves or just believe that simplified truths beget more powerful lyrics, Momma are scaling back on specifics while scaling up in sound. That makesWelcome to My Blue Sky’s barreling fuzzball of grunge-pop all the more striking.\nMining moments from the end of their early 20s, Weingarten and Friedman relate a shared memoir rife with coming-of-age charm and self-doubt. Nostalgia for youth is the whole point, even if you didn’t have a childhood worth remembering fondly. Who cares if June through August has long since stopped representing total freedom? With “Stay All Summer,” Momma unfurl a wall calendar where the numerical days mean nothing. It doesn’t matter if you’re proudly single or if you’ve had a ring on your finger so long that it’s formed a permanent indent; when the duo sing about trying to maintain a stiff upper lip after heartbreak on “New Friend,” the way their voices morph from pain into bittersweet confidence summons a familiar empathy. “My Old Street” demonstrates that Weingarten and Friedman are conversant with numerous types of longing: “Mom was getting drunker/And she’s talking like she’s younger/She told me that she missed out on her dreams/And we both miss sixteen.” That pining—for what once was, what could’ve been—is universal, even when we can’t quite put our finger on what, exactly, we miss.\nAs with 2022’sHousehold Name, where layers of guitar and vocal harmonies thickened the alt-pop slurry,Welcome to My Blue Skyis a finely tuned production that warrants textural comparisons to crushed velvet or vintage corduroy. Produced by Momma bassist Aron Kobayashi Ritch, the album harkens back to when ’90s alt-rock radio stations chased power-pop choruses with a wink (“Bottle Blonde”) and paired heady grunge fuzz with a rebellious spirit (“Rodeo”). Singles like “Ohio All the Time” are full-volume affairs best heard in a car with the windows rolled down, subwoofer rattling obnoxiously, hand extended to the wind. While the revving engine isn’t included (this time), Momma know that young-adult turbulence sounds best through crunchy guitars thatCourtney Lovewould co-sign, or the slightly warped acoustic strums in the title track that could be lifted from Ashlee Simpson’sAutobiography."
